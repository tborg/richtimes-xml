<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The morning was fair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Light, fleecy clouds floated slowly over the deep blue firmament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Not a breath of wind stirred through the branches, and the bay and ocean were smooth and bright as a mirror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The air was hot, heavy, and close, relaxing the frame and beading the brow with drops of moisture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It was just the kind of weather to inflict the largest amount of inconvenience upon the enemy in those turreted monsters, the pride of the <rs>Yankee</rs> nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> About <time>daylight</time> <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, a battery of the enemy, of not less than <num value="50">fifty</num> guns, together with about <num value="15">fifteen</num> boat howitzers, mounted on the enemy's barges, and the guns from <num value="4">four</num> monitors, opened a tremendous fire on <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Mitchell,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Mitchell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, completely enfilading it on the right and left, causing some havoc among both officers and men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The fire from the boat howitzers was particularly destructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The sharpshooters of the enemy also did considerable execution by picking on the men at the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It was by <num value="1">one</num> of these that the gallant <persName n="Boe,Lieutenant,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Boe,John,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Boe</surname></persName> was killed a Minnie ball striking, and passing through his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The men, notwithstanding this terrible shower of solid shot, shell and bullets stood to their guns nobly, and it was not until they were completely exhausted, and the enemy who had landed in force were rapidly approaching, that the order was given to retire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The enemy succeeded in capturing several of our men, whose exhausted condition prevented escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>A severe fight ensued, and our forces gradually fell back to <orgName n="Battery Wagner" type="battery">Battery Wagner</orgName>. <num value="2">Two</num> desperate but unsuccessful attempts to carry the battery by assault were made by the <rs>Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The enemy, after falling back, received reinforcements, and made a show of again moving against the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The force of the enemy engaged Friday is supposed to have been about <num value="4000">four thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Our loss in killed, wounded, and missing, will probably be about <num value="300">three hundred</num>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> The firing on both sides ceased about <time value="6:30">half-past 6</time>, when the monitors withdrew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The report that <num value="1">one</num> left during the engagement in a crippled condition was untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The whole <num value="4">four</num> were engaged throughout the action, and in the afternoon their fire upon <orgName n="Battery Wagner" type="battery">Battery Wagner</orgName> was very severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We learn, however, that the battery was very slightly injured.

<head>Situation of the cause.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> We once heard an anecdote which we consider so applicable to the present condition of affairs in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, that we hope to be excused for repeating it. A most worthy and pious clergyman &mdash; a man of strong nerves and undoubted courage &mdash; had met with an accident, by which several of his bones were broken, and he reduced to such a condition that his friends and even the attendant physician thought it impossible that he could survive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>A brother clergyman, hearing of his and plight, felt it his duty to call on him and offer him all the consolation that could be derived from recalling his well spent life, and the great amount of good he had done in his calling, delicately avoiding all open mention of what he conceived to be his rapidly approaching end. When he had concluded, the sufferer said: "All you have said is very true, and every man ought to bear it in mind, in health as well as in sickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>But you seem of me to think that I am <hi rend="italics">in extremis.</hi> Now, so far from thinking so myself, I believe that I shall, by the blessing of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, recover from the effects of this accident." And he did recover His faith made him whole once more, and he is to this day a bright and shining light of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> We observe that many of our contemporaries are addressing hortatory proclamations to the country, calling upon our people never to give up, but to fight on to the last man and the last drop of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>All this is very well in its place; but we maintain that the cause is in no such desperate condition as to require the aid of these powerful stimulants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>We have lost <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, it is true, and the enemy are advancing upon <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00327" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>But it is to be hoped that <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00328" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> will <hi rend="italics">now</hi> feel the necessity of action, although he never seems to have felt it while the enemy was besieging <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>He has, if all accounts be true, a very considerable force, and the telegraphic statement that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00329" reg="nearbymention:Grant,W.,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has <num value="100000">100,000</num> men we take to be a sheer exaggeration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>From the best information we can gather, he has not now, and never has had, more than <num value="60000">60,000</num> men. We trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, then, that <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00330" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> will take into consideration the great interests which are in his hands, and the utter loss of his military reputation that must inevitably follow a premature retreat from <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName> without offering some show of resistance to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>To be sure it will be much more difficult to offer effectual resistance now than it would have been had he united in an attack with <persName n="Pemberton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00331" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pemberton</surname></persName> and his <num value="18">eighteen</num> or <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> men. But there is still every reason to hope; if the commander will only lay aside his quiescent attitude and rouse himself to a true sense of his situation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> The question of the recognition of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> continues to present itself in foreign diplomatic circles, and to demand discussion.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> Another item of some interest is that <persName n="Roebuck,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00336" reg="mostcommon:Roebuck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Roebuck</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lindsay,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00337" reg="mostcommon:Lindsay,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"/><surname>Lindsay</surname></persName> <sic>had had</sic> an interview with the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, who gave them every encouragement to proceed with their motion in Parliament for the recognition of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/> From <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName> comes the strange statement that <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> will endeavor to have the <rs>American</rs> question submitted to the <rs>King</rs> of the <name>Belgians</name> for arbitration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/> The repeated recurrence of the press and the statesmen of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to the question of the recognition of the independence of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, shows the extent to which public sentiment and public interests in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> are involved in the struggle in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>It has been the persistent purpose and effort of the <rs>Government</rs> of the most powerful Kingdom in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to repress all sentiment and every movement which favored the acknowledgment of our existence as a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>But like the labor of Slayphus, it is a purpose never entirely accomplished &mdash; an effort never finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The leading Ministers of that Government are ever returning to the subject, and ever explaining and defining their intention and position with regard to it. It is plainly a question that will not be let alone, because of the nature and extent of the interests and sympathies connected with it. The wise monarch at the head of the <rs>French Government</rs> sees this, and is aware of the policy which should actuate the leading powers of the world on the subject, whether with reference to the commerce and welfare of nations, or to the single question of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>How far he may be able to impress his enlightened views upon other Governments remains to be seen, but he has certainly entitled himself to the most favorable and cordial sentiments of the people of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> That we had from the beginning to achieve our independence by bravery and constancy, by hard fighting in the field, and the sacrifice of our best men, we never doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>That this is the only means of obtaining so great a blessing as independence and freedom from <name>Yankee</name> domination, is still perfectly clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>We therefore look on with calmness upon the discussion of our attitude by the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>We ask nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>We know that we are entitled to separation and independence, and that if the <rs>European Governments</rs> were to do what was just they would promptly accord to us an acknowledgment that we had proved this claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>But as to the time when this is done they must decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>All we ask is that they shall take their step upon their own views of what is proper, and not from any idea that we are depending upon them or looking to them for aid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/> The point put forth in <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, that <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> will seek to have the <rs>American</rs> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> question submitted to the <rs>Belgian King</rs> for arbitration, has no probability about it. It is certainly not to be thought of by the <rs>South</rs>.--<persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>, who is so much opposed to all interference in the subject, and who had rejected the proposition of the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> for joint mediation, because he thought it could effect nothing, would hardly now propose arbitration by <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName>. </p> </div3>
