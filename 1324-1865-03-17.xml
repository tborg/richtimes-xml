The subject of this sketch was the only daughter of a widowed mother, who is borne down with grief at her loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>It was the pleasure of the writer to be intimately acquainted with her, and I often recall the many happy hours we have spent together around the family hearth, and in rambling on a summer's evening over the green hills, whose margins are washed by the waters of the noble river, near whose side she now sleeps. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> It may be a satisfaction to her distant relatives and friends to know that, though prostrated by disease and racked with pain, she often repeated their names; and in dying, though surrounded by the companions of her childhood, she left them a parting prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>To a question put by her mother as whether she was willing to go, she answered, yes ! yes ! whilst her countenance lighted up with such a sweet smile that her marble brow looked as if health had been suddenly imparted to her wasted and emaciated frame, whilst her trembling lips muttered a stanzas of that beautiful sacred ballad, "I do love <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>;" a hymn she loved to sing in life, and which the associates of her youth sung in melancholy, but dulcet strains, at her funeral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Her death is another illustration of the mutability of human designs; no person had brighter prospects for the future than she; no <num value="1">one</num> was more beloved; but it pleased Heaven to remove her from our midst, but not without evidences of her costatic bliss; and whilst it is a severe blow to her well-nigh heart broken family, and grief-stricken friends, let us profit by her example, and live that we may leave behind us as bright a record as she, and ever remembering it was her earnest wish that her friends should meet her in heaven soon.
