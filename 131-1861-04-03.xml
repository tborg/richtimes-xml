<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Equality of Taxation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The Convention proceeded to the consideration of unfinished business &mdash; namely, the resolutions on Taxation and Representation, offered by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Willey,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Willey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Willey</surname></persName></hi>, of Monongalia. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He protested against the consideration of the subject as a sectional question, question, asserting that not only the <rs>West</rs> and the <rs>Northwest</rs>, but all other sections of the <rs>State</rs>, were equally interested in it. He produced facts from the <rs>Auditor</rs>'s report to show the large number of non- slaveholding taxpayers East of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, whose interest it was to have the organic law changed in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He particularly contended for justice to the <rs>Western</rs> people, who would be called upon to fight the battles, if the <rs>State</rs> were to become involved in civil war. The present policy he argued, tended to divert capital from <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to the <rs>North</rs>, while her own natural resources remained undeveloped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He hoped the question would be taken, and that the resolutions would pass. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>This having been done-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The <rs>Chairman</rs> requested the <rs>Secretary</rs> to read the <num value="25" type="ordinal">25th</num> rule, prohibiting persons from walking about while a member was speaking. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The doctrine had been sneered at by gentlemen on this floor as ridiculous and absurd, and those who advocated it had been denounced as traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In his own remarks he intended to be courteous and respectful to all. He believed the day was not far distant when every <num value="1">one</num> here, and the whole people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, would rally to the defence of the rights of the <rs>State</rs>, and show to the world that man could and would be free. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> He maintained that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to exercise the right of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>On the <date value="1776-05-15">15th of May, 1776,</date> before the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> met, without consulting with the <rs>Border States</rs>, or asking anybody what she should do, and in the plenitude of her sovereignty and in the depth of her patriotism, severed her connection with Great British and exercised the right of secession.--Thus it was <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It was referred to by <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>, and applied as an argument in favor of the right of sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time she exercised her sovereign right, by inaugurating the movement by which, in <date value="1787">1787,</date> the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> was amended, and the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation revised so as to render them adequate to the exigencies of the <name>States</name> and to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>And yet we hear gentlemen denouncing the <rs>Convention</rs> at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> for pursuing a similar course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Carlile,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Carlile,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Carlile</surname></persName></hi> asked if he understood the gentleman as contending that the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <rs>Southern Confederated States</rs> had been referred to the people, as in the case of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Montague,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Montague,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Montague</surname></persName>.</hi>--It was substantially the same thing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Carlile,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Carlile,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Carlile</surname></persName></hi> said his information on the subject was that the <orgName n="Montgomery Convention" type="convention">Montgomery Convention</orgName> refused to refer their Constitution to the people of the several States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Mostague,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Mostague,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mostague</surname></persName></hi> replied that this was because the <name>States</name> had Conventions in session at the same time, representing them upon the subjects at issue, and hence it would have been nonsense to have referred it to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It amounted to the same thing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The speaker then proceeded to show that a State in her sovereign capacity as <num value="1">one</num> of the constituents of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, has a right to judge for herself as to the mode and measure of redress, and never merged her individuality and sovereignty into the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He quoted from <placeName reg="Madison, Dane, Wisconsin" key="tgn,7013966">Madison</placeName>'s writings to demonstrate that a breach of the compact on the <num value="1">one</num> side absolves the other, and that the compact might be then broken up. It was the principle of the individuality of the <name>States</name> that broke up the old articles of confederation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It was the doctrine of <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName> that when we, as the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, failed in all other efforts for redress of the grievances, we had the right to denounce the <rs>Federal Government</rs> and resume our powers of sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He also read the opinions of <persName n="Randolph,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Randolph,George,W.,,:2"><surname>Randolph</surname></persName>, <persName n="Pendleton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Pendleton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pendleton</surname></persName>, <persName n="Nicholas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Nicholas,nomatch:0"><surname>Nicholas</surname></persName>, and other founders of Republican liberty in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, to sustain the position which he laid down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>If he was to be denounced as a traitor, let it be for proclaiming and upholding the principles laid down by these fathers, whose opinions he had read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>[Applause in the eastern gallery.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> The <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Chairman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Chairman,nomatch:0"><surname>Chairman</surname></persName>.</hi>--The Sergeant-at-Arms will clear the gallery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> The order was obeyed, the sovereigns there assembled reserving the right to make another demonstration as they retired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName></hi> desired to know how long this order would last? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The <rs>Chairman</rs> was not aware of any limit to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName></hi> had asked the question because he wanted to ascertain the effect of it. There were many respectable citizens in the gallery who, he was sure, took no part in the disorder, while he believed that some on this floor and participate in it. He thought it hard that the innocent should be made to suffer with the guilty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> The <rs>Chairman</rs> said that this constituted the difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>He was not aware that the applause proceeded from any other place than the gallery, and it was impossible to distinguish individuals who were engaged in it. He supposed the gallery could be again thrown open after a reasonable time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName></hi> asked if they could return immediately?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He would like to know how long a reasonable time was? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> The colloquy here terminated, and the gallery door was re-opened in about <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>When the secession movement began, the country was in the plenitude of its strength; yet the evils resulted from causes which had long been operating in the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>No Union could long exist, where the people on <num value="1">one</num> side constantly exercised a spirit of hostility against the people of the other side, and to this constant agitation he attributed the present evils overshadowing the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>He proceeded to consider the question whether the sentiment of hostility at the <rs>North</rs> might be overcome and supplanted by a sentiment of kindness and friendliness to the <rs>South</rs>.--It was, he conceived, the part of wise statesmanship not to dismiss and abandon institutions like ours, without at least making <num value="1">one</num> intrepid effort to retain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>There was neither courage nor intrepidity in despair.--The peace of the world was once placed in jeopardy far more imminent under the inflaming influence of a religious controversy, than it was now under the agitation of the <name>African</name> slavery question; and yet it was found that by toleration the <name>Protestant</name> and the <rs>Roman Catholic</rs> might dwell together in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>He apprehended that in years hence it would be found that the people of this country might dwell together as peacefully as the people of any <num value="1">one</num> county in either section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>No suggestion of the futility of making an effort to this end should discourage us from making it. If success should fortunately crown the effort, there was not an individual here engaged in the work of endeavoring to restore the <rs>Union</rs>, but would establish a claim upon posterity for reverence and gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>If it were possible, by amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to close the door of agitation so that no human power could open it, was there not at least a prospect of annihilating the evils which have so wrought upon the feeling of the <rs>South</rs>?--He would not say that the report of the committee was sufficient, but he took the ground that amendments might be introduced which would satisfy, not only <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, but the whole <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The question is not whether <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> shall go with either the <rs>Northern</rs> or the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, but whether she shall continue in the <rs>Union</rs> restored and reconstructed as a whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>He could not consent to abandon the <rs>Southern States</rs>, nor the <rs>Border States</rs>; but believed that the whole Union should be preserved, and through judicious efforts the <rs>North</rs> might be brought to proper concessions, such as would satisfy the extreme <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/><placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, according to reliable information, would consent to such a scheme, and with <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> would come the whole Northwest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>With <placeName key="tgn,7007710" n="1.000 4175" reg="pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</placeName> and the <rs>Northwest</rs> united, it would be impossible to keep <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> out of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> On this point <persName n="Macfarland,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Macfarland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Macfarland</surname></persName> argued until <time value="1:30oclock">half-past 1 o'clock</time>, when he yielded the floor at the request of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Preston,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Preston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName>,</hi> who moved that the <rs>Committee</rs> rise. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> He said he had, in the morning, invited the attention of the <rs>Committee</rs> to a practical view of the method by which the great question now agitating the country might be definitely settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>His object was to show that if the subject of slavery was to be taken out of the halls of legislation, and withdrawn from the fields of agitation, we might yet live on terms of friendship and respect with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Unless this could be done, he would not consent to remain in a Union with the people of that section, for it would be by no means desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>He took the position that the <rs>Northern</rs> people were as much interested in perpetuating the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> as we were, and if the question of its extinction were presented to them, it would be decided in the negative.--They were dependent upon it for subsistence, and you might as well expect that the collieries of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would be abandoned, as that the <rs>Yankees</rs> would consent to their own impoverishment by the abolition of slavery at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>There was, he assumed, a change going on in the sentiment of the world on the subject, as shown by the employment of coolies by <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>We had a right to insist that the <rs>North</rs> should let us alone, and he believed that when the naked issue was presented, the <rs>North</rs> would recede from its aggressive position rather than encounter the evils which must result from a continued agitation of the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Alluding to the grandeur of the <rs>Union</rs> in the eyes of the world, he thought it would be time enough to pass sentence upon it after our best efforts for its preservation shall have failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>He looked upon it as altogether improbable, that war could be avoided in the event of separation; and <num value="1">one</num> single war between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> would entail upon each section an amount of suffering and waste which years of industry and successful commerce would in vain endeavor to repair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>These considerations, he conceived, would have their due weight upon the <rs>Northern</rs> mind.--Bring them to the question, slavery or war, and no sensible man would decide in favor of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>He argued that the proper way to remedy existing evils was to close the door forever against agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>If we could bring the <rs>North</rs> to agree that there should be no introduction of the slavery question in the halls of Congress, no effort to impair the relation between master and slave, the public mind would become quieted, and peace would return to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>But suppose we were mistaken in this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Would anything be lost by making the experiment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Is it not as easy to separate <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> hence as now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The relative positions of the <num value="2">two</num> sections would not be changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Everything encouraged us to make the effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>He conceived there would be no dishonor in saying to the <rs>North</rs>, we must have these guarantees, or disunion is the inevitable result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>It may be said that this has already been done; but he apprehended it had not been done in the form and with the authority here proposed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> He argued that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> ought, and might now with propriety acknowledge the independence of the <rs>Confederated States</rs>, and that it was an indispensable step towards a settlement of the difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>He agreed with the gentleman from <placeName reg="Middlesex Village, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2510683">Middlesex</placeName>, that the condition of the <rs>Confederated States</rs> was not to be disturbed by force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>He held that the <rs>Committee</rs> ought to agree upon something that would speedily settle the pending difficulty, taking care to demand enough to meet the exigencies of the case.--He spoke highly of the resources of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and the gallantry of her people, but must be permitted to say that he thought she acted with rather too much haste in going off without consulting with her Southern sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>He was not, however, disposed to quarrel with her on that account.--He apprehended that, as strong as the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> was, she would not object to an addition to her strength, if it could be done with perfect security and without sacrifice of principle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>He was in favor of a further and final effort to reconstruct the <rs>Union</rs>; and whoever should have the good fortune to so shape the course of events as to bring about a peaceful solution of the great questions at issue, would be entitled to the lasting gratitude of posterity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>He desired to give some views upon a subject so engrossing as the question under debate, but was reluctant to farther exhaust the patience of the <rs>Committee</rs> at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>He therefore moved that the <rs>Committee</rs> rise. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It was charged that he was the author of the clause exempting negroes under <measure n="12years" type="date">12 years</measure> of age from taxation, but this he utterly denied.
