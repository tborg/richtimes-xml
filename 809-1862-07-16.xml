<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> The long bombardment of a city, stubbornly resisting its assailants, is a new feature in the present war, and a picture of the scene is peculiarly interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>A gentleman from <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson, Miss.</placeName>, left there on the <dateStruct value="--27"><day reg="27">27th ult.</day></dateStruct> for <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and furnishes an interesting account to the <hi rend="italics">Mississippian</hi> of that place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>In stature he is not above the middle height, with well set person; his hair is what, in a lady, you would call auburn, but in a soldier and gentleman, sandy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>He wears it flowing and uncut, and his beard full, though not bushy or neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>His complexion is soft and blonde, almost like that of a woman, and I was told that he could, and at times actually did blush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>If I had to choose the features of his face which most clearly indicate the soldierly qualities, earnestness, judgment, and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>I should say they are found in his active, quick, keen (not solf) blue eye, his clean cut, chiseled nose, (especially the nostril,) and resolute, determined mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Being a native born Mississippian, and bringing with him here a high character as a soldier, our people generally, and our <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> friends in particular, are restored to a degree of confidence which they have not felt under the recent military regime. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> As we neared <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> more palpabie evidences of the presence of the enemy became apparent both in sight and sound. "Grim visaged war" began to show "his wrinkled front." The cars were not permitted to go entirely to the depot, but were stopped at the machine shop about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile distant</measure>; and then on foot and in wonder, and even somewhat of awe, we entered the beleaguered city, amid the roar of cannon and the sharp, hissing, hurtling sound of exploding shells. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> I had often been there before, and, in years past had been familiar not only with its localities, but with most of its worthiest and hospitable citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>I had traversed its streets and entered its houses in happier and better days; and as our party made its way along into the town, the contrast became more and more obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Places which erst had shone glorious with peace and happy faces &mdash; homes made bright and lovely with all the adornments of art and the cultivation of nature, where families had gathered and clustered around worthy and noble mothers and sires; where wealth, and kindness, and hospitality, had been dispensed with a profuse and lavish hand; the chosen and adopted home of <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="mostcommon:Prentiss,nomatch:0"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName> and his host of gallant compeers, rendered desolate, deserted, and abandoned, by a relentless and ruthless foe. Indeed, if you wish to see the greatest and best example of the self-devotion and longsuffering endurance of our people to our cause, go to <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Traverse its deserted streets; enter the sacred precincts of its churches; roam, saddened and sick at heart, through its lovely and neglected gardens; seek admittance for trade or curiosity to its closed hotels, stores, and court-rooms, and you will see of what a brave and virtuous people are capable when inspired by the noblest sentiment of humanity and true patriotism; and, yet, is not this a better fate and a nobler destiny than has befallen <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> and New Orleans?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Is it not safer, wiser, and better, to preserve freedom, faith, and honor, than to pander to a base enemy, to preserve wealth in property or safety to person!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> At our outset from the ears it was determined that we should make our way to some conspicuous point upon the river, where we could see the fleet of the enemy and witness his operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>This place we found on <address><street n="Washington street">Washington street</street></address>, in the establishment of our old friends <persName n="Hardaway,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Hardaway,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardaway</surname></persName> &amp; <persName n="White,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="mostcommon:White,nomatch:0"><surname>White</surname></persName>.--In the upper stories of this house we had a fair opportunity of observing, in comparative security, the array of gun and mortar boats, most of them being engaged the whole of that day and night in sending shell and shot at our batteries and into the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The effects up to the coming on of night had, however, been trivial, and comparatively harmless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>From our point of view, we had in sight all of the enemy's gunboats, these lying around the point and against the <rs>Louisiana</rs> shore, and also most, if not all, his mortar boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The latter had crept up during the night previous, and were lying just below the point and immediately under the bank on our own shore, thus getting nearer our batteries and commanding the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Their masts, we observed, were wrapped with the limbs of foliage of trees, intended, we suppose, as a disguise to aid them in getting so closely in upon us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> About <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time> at night the enemy again opened a terrific and deafening fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The scene was fearful and grand in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>The air and sky at times seemed <num value="1">one</num> sheet of living flame, while shells burst in mid-air, scattering their dreadful missiles of death around and over the devoted city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> This was kept up for at least <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, when, it seemed to us, from sheer exhaustion of the combatants, the firing ceased, and stilliness and midnight, like a pall, darkened and fell over the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Nothing but the light of morning could reveal the death and desolation which had ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>When that morning came, more appalling and fearful still was the scene which it presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/><num value="7">Seven</num> of the principal gunboats, with the flagboat of the enemy, for some purpose, of course unknown to, us, ran the gauntlet of our batteries, and at about <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> in the morning were at the landing, and disrectly under and opposite the town. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> Here, in conjunction with about <num value="20">twenty</num> of their mortar boats and a concealed battery upon the opposite bank of the river, they all simulteneously opened fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>We were awakened from our dreams of peace by a report and reverberation scarce equaled in volume by the terrific peals of "heaven's artillery." The whole broad bosom of the river was <num value="1">one</num> sheet of liquid flame, the houses and hills seemed to rock upon their very foundations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> came the whirring, whizzing noise of the shell, awakening the echoes far and near, and then the booming sound of the report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>To an uneducated ear, the peculiar sound made by the shell, when <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> projected from the mouth of the mortar, is terrible in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>I still hear it in my ears, and every loud, crashing sound almost startles me into the belief that I am still "under fire." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> After remaining within walls for some time, we at length determined to try the open streets, where, at least, was offered a better chance for dodging than in doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>When we reached the street, we then began to see the effects of the bombardment upon the few remaining inhabitants of the town, and upon the house along our route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>As we were merely amatuers, and our presence not absolutely essential to the safety or defence of the town, it was, upon a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName>, determined to make our way to the friendly protection of the hills on the outskirts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>All along our way we found men, women, and children flying in every direction to seek shelter and protection somewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Here would be seen a mother and helpless children, has tened perhaps in their flight from their homes by a shell having fallen upon and through their roof, or in teh yard adjoining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Here came <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the hissing sound, and then the messenger of death plowed up the streets just before you, or went crashing into some house or grassy bank almost at your back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Here we saw a poor Ireshman kneeling in profound reverence, with his face pressed to the very earth, and as we heard his earnest invocation, <foreign lang="lat">"<hi rend="italics">Ave Maria, ora pro Nobis,</hi>"</foreign> we were impressed with the thought that if the missile of death would strike him, it could not come at a better time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> We found the shells fell thicker and faster the further we went, as if the enemy sought to show how far their murderous engines would carry, or because they were "feeling" for the camps of our soldiers, which they supposed were in range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Thus, from <num value="4">four</num> until <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> did this hellish work continue, and by an enemy whose proud boast is that they "never make war upon unoffending citizens and helpless women and children." <name n="God" type="God">God</name> save the mark!! We gradually found our way back to our stopping place, and after a good breakfast betook ourselves to ranging the city to learn the casualties and incidents of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Compared with the "sound and fury" these were comparatively trifling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Within the whole bounds of the city we could hear of out <num value="1">one</num> death; but this was a most estimable lady, <persName n="Gamble,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Gamble,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Gamble</surname></persName>, who we were told had been <num value="1">one</num> of the msot active in acts of kindness and labor for our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>She was struck with a splinter and died instantly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> At the batteries we had but <num value="2">two</num> men killed and <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5" type="wounded">five wounded</measure>. An incident at <num value="1">one</num> of our guns is worthy of recording, and should immortalize the actor in it. A soldier stationed with his finger at the vent, while the gun was being loaded, had the hand he was thus using dreadfully mangled with a fragment of shell, and yet he nobly held it in position until the guners had finished loading the piece; because if he had for an instant released his hold death would have been inevitable to his companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Can people exhibiting such traits ever be conquered? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> A great number of houses were struck; many of them entirely gutted and destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The Methodist and Catholic churches were both struck, the former in the cupola and basement with <num value="2">two</num> shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The small loss of life is perhaps attributable to the fact that most of the occupants were absent, and many fled temporarily from their houses into the streets and open country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> Thus terminated for us the scenes of which I fear I have given but a faint idea from my imperfect manner of description.
