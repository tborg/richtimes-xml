<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The following is an extract: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> Upon national topics <persName n="Trumbull,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName> discountenanced the idea of triumphing over political opponents, accepting all, by whatever name called, as brethren of a common country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>He said <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, although the candidate of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, as <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> will neither belong to that or any other party when inaugurated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>He will be the <rs>President</rs> of the country, and of the whole country; and I doubt not will be as ready to defend and protect the <rs>State</rs> in which he has not received a solitary vote against any encroachment upon its constitutional rights, as the <num value="1">one</num> in which he has received the largest majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>While they by whose votes he has been designated as <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> of the people will expect him to maintain and carry forward the principles on which he was elected, they know that in doing so no encroachments will be made on the reserved rights of any of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>They know that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> is <num value="1">one</num> of delegated powers; that it can do nothing except the authority for the act can be found in the instrument which created it; that all powers not conferred are reserved to the <name>States</name> or the people of the <name>States</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/> Hence, when their political opponents have charged them with abolitionism, or attributed to them a desire to interfere with slavery in the <name>States</name>, or some fanatic has insisted they ought to do so, the reply has invariably been that the people, who made the federal government, did not think proper to confer it on such authority; and <hi rend="italics">it has, therefore, no more right to meddle with slavery in a State than it has to interfere with serfdom in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.</hi> Nor are the people of the non slaveholding States in any way responsible for slavery in the <name>States</name> which tolerate it, because as to that question they are as foreign from each other as independent governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>I have labored in and for the republican organization with entire confidence that, whenever it should be in power, each and all of the <name>States</name> would be left in as complete control of their own affairs, respectively, and at as perfect liberty to choose and employ their own means of protecting property and preserving peace and order within their respective limits, as they have ever been under any administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Those who have voted for <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> have expected and still expect this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They would not have voted for him had they expected otherwise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> I regard it as extremely fortunate for the peace of the whole country that this point, upon which the <name>Republicans</name> have been so long and so persistently misrepresented, is now to be brought to a practical lest and placed beyond the possibility of doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>It should be a matter of rejoicing to all true Republicans that they will now have an opportunity of demonstrating to their political adversaries and to the world that they <hi rend="italics">are not for interfering with the domestic institutions of any of the <name>States</name>, nor the advocates of negro equality,</hi> or of amalgamation, with which political demagogues have so often charged them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>When this is shown, a reaction will assuredly take place in favor of Republicanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The Southern mind, even, will be satisfied; the rights of Northern men will be respected, and the fraternal feeling existing in olden times, when men from all parts of the country went forth together to battle for a common cause against a common enemy, will be restored. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> Disunionists, <hi rend="italics">per se,</hi> of whom unfortunately there has been a few in the country for some years, understand this, and are now in hot haste to get out of the <rs>Union</rs>, precisely because they perceive they cannot much longer maintain an apprehension among the <rs>Southern</rs> people that their homes, and firesides, and lives, are to be endangered by the action of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>With such, "now or never" is the maxim; hence they seek to inflame the public mind by misrepresenting the objects and purposes of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, with the hope of precipitating some of the <rs>Southern States</rs> into positions from which they cannot without dishonor afterwards recede, well knowing if they delay till after the new administration is inaugurated and tested, it will furnish no cause for their complaints. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> Secession is an impracticability, or rather an impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The Constitution provides no way by which a State may withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>--no way for the dissolution of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>It creates the general good, interferes but little with the individual rights of the citizen, except for protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>It is chiefly felt in its benefits and its blessings &mdash; not its exactions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>If every federal officer in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> were to resign, their offices remain vacant, and its Legislature declare the <rs>State</rs> out of the <rs>Union</rs>, it would all amount to little except to inconvenience the citizens of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>So long as the <rs>State</rs> did not interfere with the collection of the revenue on the seaboard, the people in other portions of the <rs>Union</rs> would not be in the least incommoded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>What is the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> army to do when raised ? Whom is it to fight?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Manifestly, if it commences a war on the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> officers engaged in collecting the revenues, it becomes the aggressor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>This would be revolution, and making war without a cause; for <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> makes no complaint against the present revenue laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Is she prepared for this &mdash; to become the aggressor?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The only use I can see for her Minute Men is, that they will enable the people the more readily to suppress any uprisings in their midst which their misrepresentations of purposes may have encouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>She complains that the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs> is not executed in some of the <name>States</name>.--This, if true, the whole country knows to be a sham. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> So far as <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> is concerned, she is so situated that no slave can escape from her limits into free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>However much cause the border slave States may have to complain of the escape of their negroes into the free States, it is clear <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> can have no such complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>In her resolves she professes to be preparing to defend herself against encroachments on her rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Let her adhere to this policy, and not attempt to dictate to other States what they shall do, and no collision will occur, for no encroachments will be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The disunion feeling in the <rs>South</rs> is doubtless greatly exaggerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>A sort of terrorism seems to prevail in some places, which for the time appears to have crushed out any manifestation of Union sentiment; but as the causes for this excitement are all imaginary &mdash; the election of a Republican <rs type="role2">President</rs> in the constitutional mode certainly affording no excuse for it &mdash; it is reasonable to suppose that a reaction will soon take place among the <rs>Southern</rs> people themselves, which will overthrow the disunionists at home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> It is a great mistake to class the supporters of <persName n="Breckinridge,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> as disunionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Some few of them may be, but <persName n="Breckinridge,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> himself, and his supporters as a class, are, I doubt not, as sincerely attached to the <rs>Union</rs> as many of those who, for political purposes, during the recent excited contest, sought to fasten upon them the stigma of disunion.--Should the conservative and Union men in any particular locality be unable to cope with their adversaries, and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> or any other State, under the lead of nullifiers and disunionists, who have for years been seeking a pretext for breaking up the government, plunge into rebellion, and without cause assail by force of arms the constituted authorities of the <rs>Union</rs>, there will be but <num value="1">one</num> sentiment among the great mass of the people of all parties and in all parts of the country, and that will be--"the <rs>Union</rs>, it must and shall be preserved;" and woe to the traitors who are marshalled against it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>As the latitude of this region ranges between <num value="47">forty-seven</num> and <num value="50">fifty</num> North, the wonder has been, not at the richness or rarity of the deposit, but at the fact of their having been found in such an out-of-the-way place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Geologists argued, from this supposed antiquity, that the world was made much more than <measure n="6000years" type="date">six thousand years</measure> ago.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>They found other arguments, of a totally different character, to prove that the <name>Mosaic</name> theory was wrong, and that the world was created many ages before the time assigned by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Moses,Alfred,,,:2"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>.</hi> Many eminently pious men became convinced by the study of geology, and endeavored to reconcile its discoveries to the book of Genesis, by supposing that the <num value="6">six</num> day's means <num value="6">six</num> indefinite periods, of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, or, it might be, <num value="1000000">millions</num>, of years, during which Almighty power was preparing the world for the habitation of man. Recent discoveries seem to show that they took a great deal of unnecessary trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Vestiges of man, contemporaneous with the remains of elephants, hippopotami, and other tropical animals, and lying intermingled with them in vast heaps, have been discovered in that quarter of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> to which we have alluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>No human bones, it is true, have been discovered; but hatchets, knives, tools of various kinds' and warlike instruments in abundance, exist among the vestiges of the animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>They are made of flint, and the ablest geologists have decided, not only that they are of human workmanship, but that they are quite as old as the remains among which they were deposited. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/> What are we to infer from these discoveries?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>That the human race is older than we are told it is by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Moses,Alfred,,,:2"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>!</hi> Not at all, according to our view of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Now, vast vestiges of the race have been discovered, the only fair inference is that the bones of the animals are not so old as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Cuvier,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Cuvier,nomatch:0"><surname>Cuvier</surname></persName></hi> supposed.--In other words, they are not older than the human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>The question, then, turns upon the age of the human race, and for that we have no positive authority but the book of Genesis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>No discovery of any human remains bearing traces of an antiquity greater than <measure n="6000years" type="date">six thousand years</measure>, so far as we know, have ever been discovered.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/> "They spring, in my opinion, from imperfect and erroneous ideas as to what constitutes rational freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>There is prevalent a vague and undefined notion, that government is free in proportion as license is allowed the citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>No such vagary had possession of the minds of our ancestors when they instituted our Government &mdash; No!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>They had been tried in the furnace of self-denial, and were accustomed to restraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>They had devoted, and were ready to devote, themselves and their substance to their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>They had governed and restrained themselves, and knew what was meant by the declaration, 'that man is capable of self-government.' But we have now had almost uninterrupted peace and prosperity for more than half a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>Most of the present generation are free, without ever having themselves made a single struggle, or undergone single sacrifice for freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>It is the birth-right of every citizen, and seems natural, easy and cheap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>They forget the immense sacrifices and toils with which our liberties were purchased, and do not remember that we can preserve them only by restraining our passions and rendering daily obedience to the laws of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>No people understand and appreciate the spirit and substance of liberty, who are not ready to make, and who do not make, sacrifices for her maintenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>No people are capable of self-government who will not and do not feel the necessity for, and by their acts acknowledge, the supremacy of the law. A liberty that costs nothing, is worth nothing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/> "Men desire to do as they please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>They violate the laws and think they should not suffer for it. There could be no freedom if such opinions were to prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>A strong man could with impunity despoil his weak neighbor of his goods, but he would not be happy or free; for a 'stronger than he' would come and in like manner despoil him of his goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>The weak and helpless would be at the mercy of the strong, and the strong carry on continued warfare among themselves.--To let men do as they please, is to destroy liberty by banishing peace and order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Few, if any, are bold enough openly to favor such a state of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>All desire the advantages of good government, but there are too many who are unwilling to pay their part of the cost, by rendering individual personal obedience to the laws.
