<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The excited reports circulated in the city <rs>Saturday</rs>; about the capture of <num value="2">two</num> whole brigades of Confederates on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> by the <rs>Yankees</rs>, turn out to have been greatly exaggerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>We are enabled, from conversation with a number of wounded officers and men who were in the fight, to give a fuller and more reliable narrative of the affair than has been published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The fight occurred near <placeName reg="Kelley's Ford">Kelley's Ford</placeName>, our forces being on the further side of the river, and the <rs>Yankees</rs> appearing in force to drive them off and force a passage of the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The Confederates engaged were <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Hayes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Hayes,nomatch:0"><surname>Hayes</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, consisting of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="9LARegiment">9th Louisiana regiments</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Hays,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Hays,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hays</surname></persName>; and the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="30NCRegiment">30th N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>win. </p> 
<p>These troops had been stationed on the north side of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, doing picket service, when, about <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the drums beat to quarters, and orders were given that every man must fall into the ranks and be prepared for an immediate attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In a very short time our outpost pickets and the enemy's skirmishers were hotly engaged, our own pickets gradually yielding the ground to superior numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The main body of the enemy was not long in making its appearance, emerging from the woods, and soon our small force were confronted by overwhelming numbers, estimated at between <num value="10">ten</num> and <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Then commenced a terrific battle, which continued without intermission from <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> in the afternoon till dark, at which time, it seems, we had been entirely surrounded, and a large portion of our troops had already fallen into the hands of the <rs>Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The situation becoming desperate, and it appearing that the longer resistance was continued on our side the less chance there would be of escape, orders were given for a retreat, which was done under very great disadvantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The bridge crossing the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> being commanded by the enemy in such a manner as to render it madness to attempt to cross by that means, the whole of our retreating force took to the river, which they forded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The number which fell into the hands of the enemy is about <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We learn that the <orgName type="regiment" key="6NCRegiment">6th North Carolina regiment</orgName> entire fell into their hands, and that about <num value="400">400</num> of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Hayes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Hayes,nomatch:0"><surname>Hayes</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> also failed to escape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The fight is represented to have been of the most terrific character, and when we take into consideration the great disparagement in the <num value="2">two</num> forces engaged it is remarkable that any of our gallant men escaped at all. For the space of <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> in an open field, we learn, that the ground seemed late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>rally swarming with <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, who, to adopt the expression of <num value="1">one</num> of the wounded, seemed to rise up out of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In this fight their artillery was used with great efficiency, and, unlike what has hitherto been their practice, it was used at shorter range than usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Part of the time the conflict was hand-to-hand, and it was in this manner that the most of our men were pressed upon by overpowering numbers and compelled to yield up to them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> It is regretted that our artillery were not supplied with shrapnel shot, as it is believed greater destruction could have been done with them than the solid shot which were used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Never were guns more stubbornly defended or more efficiently man&#339;uvred, and charge after charge was repulsed before the enemy finally succeeded in capturing them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> At <num value="1">one</num> stage of the battle the impetuosity of <persName n="Hayes,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hayes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hayes</surname></persName> led him into the very heart of the enemy's ranks, and before he was aware of it he was hemmed in on all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Drawing his sword and putting spurs to his horse, he dashed through them, and finally escaped capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In his flight he leaped a parapet of considerable height, and plunging his horse into the river reached the south bank of the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock</placeName> uninjured. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It is also believed that <persName n="Godwin,Colonel,A.,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Godwin,A.,C.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Godwin</surname></persName> is a prisoner, as on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, the day after the battle, both brigades were under the charge of <persName n="Hayes,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Hayes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hayes</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The list of killed and wounded on our side will probably not exceed <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="400">four hundred</num>, a very small proportion of whom being officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><persName n="Sellers,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Sellers,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Sellers</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="30NCRegiment">30th North Carolina regiment</orgName>, received a mortal wound in the right breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This officer led his regiment into the fight on foot, and is represented to have showed great fearlessness, and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In the early part of the engagement he received a severe wound in the arm, but refused to leave the field, and continued to cheer on his men till later in the evening, when he was struck the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, and had to be borne off the field, <persName n="Weatherspoon,Captain,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="default:Weatherspoon,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Weatherspoon</surname></persName>, of <orgName type="company" n="Company K">company K</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="30NCRegiment">30th N. C. regiment</orgName>, was also severely wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> Among the <rs>Yankees</rs> it is believed that several General officers were killed, as a short time before the close of the day, and when perhaps the enemy thought they had captured all our troops, a group of mounted officers, evidently prominent leaders, rode right into a party of our troops who were in a ravine, when they immediately rose up and fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> of them escaped, as they were seen to fall apparently lifeless from their horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Previous to this <num value="1">one</num> <name>Yankee</name> officer was seen to fall wounded, and afterwards, in a prostrate condition, continued for several minutes to fire at our men till a well directed shot succeeded in ending his career on this earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>There was no fighting yesterday, but information was received through the wounded that on <name>Sunday</name> a heavy fight occurred about <placeName><distance reg="1mile">one mile</distance> beyond <placeName reg="Culpeper Court House">Culpeper C.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> It is not true philanthropy which has inspired the <name>Abolitionists</name> in their course with regard to the <rs>Southern</rs> negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>With them the question has been, not how many slaves would be benefited by abolition, but how much it would irritate and harass the slaveholders and contribute to the gratification of a sectional malice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>During the present war <num value="1000">thousands</num> of negroes have been released from servitude to their masters, but we say unhesitatingly that in <measure n="9cases" type="mass">nine cases</measure> out of <num value="10">ten</num>, if not in a far greater ratio, the change has been positively injurious to their condition, morally and physically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>How many are happier? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> It has been developed during the progress of military events in the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> that trading in negroes is not an uncommon kind of speculation among Northern men in Federal service. --There is a case of a superintendent of contrabands at <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>, who was discovered to be extensively engaged in this business, and was finally arrested for selling a young negro for <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> to his master in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

Such talk in <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 8170" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> sounds badly, but we have reason to believe that it was literally true." </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Some of the <rs>Northern</rs> cities are overrun with "freedmen."--Many, perhaps, are disposed to work, but such are kept in the same menial condition as when they were slaves, and few of them are so well treated, fed, or clothed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>It is a fact, apparent and undeniable, that there is less sympathy for the negro at the <rs>North</rs> than in the <rs>Southern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> The contraband camps, established by the <rs>Government</rs>, have been little else than pens of idleness, squalor and disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>We shudder to think of the scores of hundreds, of black men, women and children whose miserable deaths are attributable solely to the change in their condition produced by the war &mdash; to their own helplessness, and to the neglect and indifference of those whom they in their ignorant and strange faith, looked upon as their benefactors and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>In the cities they wander about in poverty and despair until they sicken, and the cold ground shuts them in from a colder world.

<head>A battle Imminent.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> The battle which we announced to our readers as certain to come off in a few days has, in all probability, already commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>There seems to be no doubt that <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> is advancing with his whole force, as we anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The pressure of public opinion in the <rs>North</rs> has compelled <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to order a battle peremptorily, and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is not likely to decline any offer of that sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>He has the advantage of selecting his own ground, in a country he thoroughly knows, and this is half the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>He has not, we presume, so many men as <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> may have, but his men are all veterans, and fully equal to the task of beating any force <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> may be able to bring against it. The opening of the campaign was unfortunate, but the misfortune was not of a character or of an extent to cause any uneasiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Pickets are frequently captured in this manner upon a sudden advance, and yet the capture seldom has any influence upon the result of a pitched battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>We have no fears for <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, or for the result of the approaching battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Our only fear is that it will not turn out to be decisive, and that the enemy when beaten will not be pursued with sufficient vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>These long, desperate, bloody, battles, without result, are characteristic of this war, and should, we think, be avoided where it is possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>We have not the slightest fear that <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> will be successful, and therefore we have no apprehensions for <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> from that quarter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> With respect to the unfortunate surprise of the <num value="2">two</num> brigades, we know as yet very little, and shall therefore decline expressing an opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>We know, however, that whenever pickets are surprised and captured in this way there is a fault, and a great fault, somewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>We hope the officers who are to blame will be brought to trial and properly punished, that such occurrences may be avoided for the future. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/> "On the subject of the war the <rs>General</rs> is reticent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It gives him pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>To a question in regard to it he shook his head, replying, 'That is a matter I do not talk upon; it is a subject for others to discuss, and not for me to dwell upon in my old age. It is in other hands, and must now engage the attention of other heads.'" </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> We can easily conceive that the subject "gives him pain." We are willing to suppose that this pain arises in some degree from other feelings besides personal disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>This man is a Virginian, and, if he can look upon the land in which he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> drew breath, and which once so delighted to honor him, subjected to such woes and sufferings as she has borne for nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, he must be not a man, but a monster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>He has passed a great part of his life in the <rs>North</rs>, and he cannot but know the difference between the <num value="2">two</num> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Whatever the ribald hirelings of the <rs>Northern</rs> press may say of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="nearbymention:Scott,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> knows, of his own personal observation, the pure and generous character of the <rs>Virginia</rs> people; the simple virtues of their agricultural firesides; the high tone of morality and personal honor, and of humble and unaffected Christianity which distinguish the great mass of her community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>He knows, too, just as well the selfish, corrupt, licentious, godless traits of the <rs>Northern</rs> populace, and when he sees this herd of brutish beasts let loose to ravage and destroy the once powerful and happy plains and hillsides where he roved in childhood, the war may well give him pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Well may it give him pain to think of such soil desecrated by the vandal feet of mercenaries from every clime; its modest churches defaced with licentious and sacrilegious inscriptions; its hospitable dwellings burned to the ground, and the families which once delighted to entertain the stranger and give refuge to the distressed driven from their own homesteads and made wanderers on the face of the earth; its best blood flowing like water on a <num value="100">hundred</num> battle-fields, and its very graves polluted by the infernal orgies of the fiends who have been let loose to work their will of demoniac hatred upon the living and the dead.
