<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It was this: <q>"&gt;<hi rend="italics">Be not deceived.</hi>"</q> I, of course, knew not why the sable speaker uttered these words with such emphasis, but it occurred to me that I might, with equal propriety and earnestness, urge the same scriptural quotation upon <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>This process, hitherto, we believe, unknown in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, was admirably executed by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Having never before witnessed such an operation, we beheld it with great interest, and were much impressed with the illustration it afforded of the prompt and cheerful obedience which the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> always render to authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The term "galleries," as used in the <rs>Convention</rs>, includes the <num value="1">one</num> gallery of the building properly so called, and the large vacant space in the rear of the seats occupied by members, which is allotted to spectators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>At the time the order was given, as, indeed, on every day since the assembling of the <rs>Convention</rs>, every inch of available space was occupied by an interested and respectful audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The audiences which daily attend this body are made up of gentlemen from all parts of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, as well as those of our own citizens who have leisure for such a purpose, and certainly, to <num value="1">one</num> who has seen the disorderly and ill-bred multitudes who fill the galleries of Congress and of Northern Legislatures, a greater contrast could not be imagined than is presented by the spectators at the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName>, mostly a grave, decorous, dignified body of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> gentlemen, who have as substantial interests in society, as much intelligence and respectability in every way as the <rs>Convention</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>There are of course exceptional cases, just as there are in the <rs>Convention</rs>, but not at all more numerous than may be found in that respectable body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Besides this, many of these gentlemen have ladies under their charge, often members of their own families, who have a claim upon their protection, and whom they must leave in a house full of strangers, unattended, under an order to clear the galleries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>We are therefore not surprised that this is a rare process in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, where such a thing as a mob is unknown, and that its inauguration in the present instance was regretted by many who do not approve the involuntary applause which accompanied the remark of <rs type="role">Mr.</rs><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Goode,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:Goode,nomatch:0"><surname>Goode</surname></persName>,</hi> that "<placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would never submit to a President on the <rs>Chicago</rs> platform," and which applause led to the clearing of the galleries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Whilst we are fully of the opinion that all who visit a deliberative assemblage ought to be governed by its rules, we cannot help thinking that some allowances might be made, in these exciting, revolutionary times, for the unpremeditated guilt of those who involuntarily applauded a Virginia sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The applause, at the worst, was not vehement, and was not participated in by the great body of spectators.--Nevertheless, the innocent in such cases have to suffer with the guilty, and we saw staid, quiet gentlemen, many of whom would never dream of applauding anything in the <rs>Convention</rs>, who had committed no breach of propriety, but were silent, respectful listeners to the debate, compelled to leave the house and give up for <num value="1">one</num> day (we believe that is the extent of the exile on such occasions,) the privilege of gratifying their natural curiosity to witness the proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>At the same time, we acknowledge that the <rs>Convention</rs> has the right to enforce order, and would invoke the people to aid them in this lawful endeavor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>We know not how they can better promote this object than by staying away, and denying themselves the very questionable luxury of standing up in a dense crowd, to listen to debates which they can read at their ease in the morning papers, and which at present possess no special interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Another remedy, we observe, has been suggested by <num value="1">one</num> of the members, in the shape of an adjournment of the <rs>Convention</rs> to <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>This would be also effectual in ensuring order and quiet, and we are sure no citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> would interpose the slightest objection to such a movement. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The closing of an avenue of approach, the security of a single road or river, or even the strategic movement of a small body of troops, often effects, in the beginning, what afterwards cannot be accomplished by large fortifications and the most formidable armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>He paid no attention to a summons made by the officer, but that functionary soon summoned a posse, and attempted to arrest him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>An order issued by the former, forbidding them to wear arms in the day-time, was contemptuously and ostentatiously disregarded, and they all went to the trial with their revolvers buckled around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>He hoped the citizens would in future abstain from all demonstrations of applause in the hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>It was a solemn work in which the <rs>Convention</rs> was now engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Its action might, and doubtless would, determine the destiny of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> for all time to come; and while it was natural that the eagle eye of the people, jealous of her honor, should be riveted on this body, he hoped they would remember the remark of <persName><foreName>Mirabeau</foreName></persName> in the <rs>French Assembly</rs>, that <q>"the silence of the people is a lesson to <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Kings</placeName>"</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/> He repeated the inquiry made yesterday, What ought <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to do, in this the most trying and perilous hour in her history?--That was the all-absorbing question which must be answered by this Convention &mdash; answered before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the country &mdash; answered plainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>flatly, and unequivocally; and if they fail to answer it, they fail to meet the just expectations of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/> Gentlemen might chant <unclear>pa ans</unclear> to the <rs>Union</rs>, but the <rs>Union</rs> was already dissolved &mdash; the <rs>Union</rs> of <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, which the fathers formed, and which he had hitherto cherished with fond devotion: which, in the language of the <rs>Father</rs> of his Country, he had been accustomed to look upon as the <name>Palladium</name> of our liberty and prosperity &mdash; was numbered among the things that were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>What then, would <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>Would she be true to herself and her historical renown, and nobly vindicate her ancient fame, or was her brave blood altogether extinct, and were we prepared to lower her proud flag, and permit her to humble her pride by submitting to the yoke of Northern abolitionism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>Shall we go to the house of our enemies, or to the house of our friends?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>Will <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> east her lot with her sisters of the <rs>South</rs>, or still hope on hope ever &mdash; hope against hope &mdash; trusting her interests and her honor to the leader mercies of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00299" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>?--For himself, he had no hesitation in saying that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> should now, promptly and with out delay, declare herself out of the <rs>Union</rs>, and take her position at the head of the <rs>Southern</rs> column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>He believed that immediate separation from the from the <rs>Northern Confederacy</rs> would be a peaceful measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>The coercion of the seceded States would be attempted by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00300" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>The tone of the <rs>Northern</rs> press &mdash; the declarations of their representative men &mdash; the votes of their <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and Representatives in Congress &mdash; the action of their State Legislatures &mdash; the collection of Federal troops at the <rs>Federal</rs> metropolis &mdash; the reported declarations of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00301" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> himself &mdash; the organization and drilling of Northern Wide-Awakes &mdash; all these considerations should be sufficient to convince the most skeptical on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>They may not attempt to march their mercenaries into a seceded State, but they will attempt to collect the revenue and retake the captured forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Would our Southern brethren submit to this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>It was a slander on their good name and fame to entertain the idea for <num value="1">one</num> single moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>Talk about the <name n="Stamp Act" type="legislation">stamp act</name> and the tax on tea which kindled revolutionary fires in former days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>To his mind, the most horrible attempt that could be made on earth would be to wring tribute from an unwilling people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>The Union could never be restored by the power of the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>It had been preserved heretofore in the hearts and affections of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>If coercion is attempted, the blood of slaughtered patriots will be like the dragons' teeth of old, sown upon the earth, from which would spring forth heroes ready to go into battle.--They might attempt to coerce a seceded State, but would never attempt to coerce a united South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>When old <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> places herself at the head of the column, the other border States will quickly wheel into line; and then, and not till then, will Northern coercion be abandoned; then, and not till then, will grim visaged war smooth its wrinkled front, and peace return to bless the land; then, and not till then, will the <rs>Union</rs> be restored, as given us by our fathers, and move forward again in a career of glory and prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>What a glorious chaplet will be bound upon the brow of our venerated mother, if, in the <rs>Providence</rs> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, it shall be her destiny to give peace to this distracted country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Not only will the people of this land, but people of all nations of the earth will rise to bless her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/> He sympathized with those who desired a restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, but would remind them that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> could never be instrumental in producing such a result, until she left the side of the oppressor and took the part of the oppressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>He proceeded to allude to the act of the <rs>Southern States</rs> a year ago, in sending Commissioners here, to take counsel upon measures of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> turned coldly from them, and it was natural they should feel some distrust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>But when <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> wheels into the line, and peace shall be happily restored, her Southern sisters will listen to her invitation, and come back to the <rs>Union</rs> which she helped to reconstruct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>They will come &mdash; not like the prodigal son, as some have said here &mdash; not in sack-cloth and ashes &mdash; but glorying in what they have done; and will say to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, in the beautiful language of <persName n="Ruth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00302" reg="nearbymention:Ruth,Samuel,,,"><surname>Ruth</surname></persName> to Naomi--<q>"Whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodges, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy <name n="God" type="God">God</name> my <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.--Where thou diest I will die, and there will I be buried.--</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/> If <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> cannot reconstruct the <rs>Union</rs>, she can effect a peaceable separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>If she cannot live in a Northern Confederacy, she has the right to depart in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>She can either restore the <rs>Union</rs>, or secure a peaceable and final separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>It is no longer a question of Union or disunion, but will she go <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>Every consideration of interest and honor requires that she should go with her Southern sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>They are bone of her bone, and flesh of her flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Could <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> desert them now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>As well might it be asked could the mother desert and forget her own offspring. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>Yet they had submitted to the hardships until now &mdash; when a President was about to be inaugurated by a party who denounced the <rs>Constitution</rs> of our fathers as a league with death, and a covenant with hell --they had determined to cut loose and leave the result with the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of battles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/> He had no doubt that the <rs>Southern Government</rs> would be the most virtuous <num value="1">one</num> ever administered; but even in the event that it were to resort to direct taxation, he had no desire to escape taxation at the expense of honor.--<placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would at least receive the benefits of the taxation, while now she is taxed for the benefit of the <rs>North</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/> In connection with these resolutions, he said it was his earnest desire, when the controversy <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> commenced, that an appeal should have been made by the <name>Legislatures</name> of the <rs>Southern States</rs> to the <name>Legislatures</name> of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and to the representatives in Congress assembled, to see if some method could not have been adopted to bring peace and quiet to the country, as suggested by the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> article of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, viz: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/> Here, then, is the method pointed out by that great instrument to cement every State in the bonds of brotherhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>Here are the directions pointed out by the <rs>Father</rs> of his Country in his last moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>He (<rs type="role">Mr.</rs> G.) had loved the <rs>Union</rs>, and if he could make it as it was designed to be, he would this day fling to the breeze the banner of the stars and stripes, and let it float from the <rs>Aroostook</rs> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, from the <rs>Atlantic</rs> to the <rs>Pacific</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>But the <rs>Union</rs> is dissolved, and how?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>Not by a trial of the remedy the fathers prescribed; not by the rule to which he had called the attention of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>They had been disregarded, and without any resort to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, a portion of the <name>States</name> had seceded and assumed to set up a government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>He would say, with all respect to the opinions of others, in whatever position he might assume, that there was no warrant in the <rs>Constitution</rs> by which a State had the right to secede from the <rs>Union</rs> at all. Though this was his position, he would be ready at the proper time to co-operate with those who differed with him. In the event of the failure of the constitutional remedy, there could remain but <num value="1">one</num> resort, and that was an appeal from the compact to the law of self-preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>In this connection he quoted from the writings of <persName n="Madison,,James,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00312" reg="default:Madison,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>The speaker went on to say that he believed in the doctrine of self-preservation &mdash; the right to defend life, liberty and property &mdash; to defend wife and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>That right had never been taken from us, but it was an extraordinary right, reserved to operate when the constitution fails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>He believed that secessionists would have no better protection than the right of revolution; and when the time arrived for its exercise, he would stand side by side with them in vindicating the honor of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>But he desired that every constitutional remedy should be exhausted <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>The speaker proceeded to allude to the glories of the past; to the feelings derived there from which enabled him to take by the hand citizens in every portion of the country and call them brothers; and to the patriotism of the women of all sections which prompted them to preserve the shrine at <placeName reg="Mount Vernon, Knox, Ohio" key="tgn,2080902">Mount Vernon</placeName>, where he hoped they might always come and pour out their united prayers for the protection of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/> In reference to the causes which produced the present state of affairs, he said he might call up many, but appealed to his hearers rather to act the part of the wise men in the temple, who took care of the jewels without stopping to ask who applied the torch. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/> In proceeding, he spoke of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00313" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, whom he knew in Congress, and his acquaintance had led him to anticipate better things than had lately been developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>He thought, since his recent speeches, that there was no hope for the future through him.--With regard to the collection of Federal troops at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, he said it was unfortunate that <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00314" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> was called there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Yet when the power at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> or elsewhere is brought to bear on this Common wealth, all here will stand united as <num value="1">one</num> man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>He cited statistics to show that <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Cotton</foreName></persName> had a rival in colonies with which <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> had made treaties, and to show that the argument contemplating her fostering care was fallacious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>He then alluded to the tobacco and other great interests of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, which ought not to be made subject to <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Cotton</foreName></persName>; and the consideration of their protection would not permit <persName n="Virginians,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00317" reg="mostcommon:Virginians,nomatch:0"><surname>Virginians</surname></persName> to become reconciled to the introduction of <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> in place of the negroes, who would, as had been told us, all be required to cultivate the cotton of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/> To obviate all the difficulties, he proposed that there should be a confederation of all the border slave States of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>It was too late for consultation with the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/> He was opposed to precipitate action.--When they got into this consultation and formed a Constitution &mdash; which they had a right to do as well as the <num value="6">six</num> States which <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> had gone out &mdash; they could invite all the other States to come into their confederation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>He would not stop at New York, as some did, but would invite all. As to the idea that there must be in all respects a perfect identity of interests, he believed that when it was carried out it was calculated to stir up feelings that should not exist between members of a common family. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/> He thought that there was no positive assurance that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> would afford sufficient protection to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> &mdash; no assurance that the plan laid down by the <rs>Provisional Government</rs> would be permanent.--He complained of the <rs>North</rs>--he denounced her. But had not the <rs>South</rs> sometimes violated the laws by the importation of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slaves; and if this had been done before, was there any security that it would not be done under a Provisional Southern Government?--With the competition to which <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would be thus subjected, she would stand in still further danger from those whom she made strangers and aliens on the other side of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName>. <persName n="Goggin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00318" reg="mostcommon:Goggin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Goggin</surname></persName> also alluded to the threatened prohibition of the inter-State slave trade, and to other subjects in connection there with. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>The time was past when we should ask the people of the <rs>North</rs> to go into consultation; but had we asked it, and had it been denied us, we should not to-day have witnessed the spectacle here of divided counsels.
