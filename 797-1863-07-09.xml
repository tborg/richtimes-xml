<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> The question frequently suggests itself, suppose we abandon <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, what benefit would the <rs>Federal Government</rs> derive &mdash; what injury would it entail upon the <rs>Confederacy</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Suppose we should give up those places and thus gratify the cravings of the great <rs>West</rs>, yield to her at this day that boon for which she has expended so much blood and treasure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>I say, what would be the advantages and disadvantages?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Let us look back on the page of history for the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> and then judge the future by the past. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> The object held in view by the <rs>West</rs> for the prosecution of the war is, that the possession of these places would give them the free and unobstructed navigation of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, and as a necessary consequence, its commerce and that of its tributaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The commerce and trade of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> is absolutely essential to the existence of the <rs>Western</rs> people, who have <num value="2">two</num> great and powerful motives in carrying on the war, and from their stand-point, for the of the motives I have not the heart to condemn them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> motive I have named, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is to escape from the thraldom and avarice of their <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/><placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> figures as the banker and aristocrat; while the <rs>West</rs> is the silly goose of a dependent, and a hewer of wood and a drawer of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>To wish to escape from this latter position I can blame no people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> True, the <rs>South</rs> has proposed to give the <rs>Western</rs> people the free navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>; but either in their blindness or their inability to escape from the meshes thrown around them by the <rs>Abe Lincoln Government</rs>, the proposition was not accepted.--The <rs>West</rs> has still waged the war, and every blow that it has struck has only tended the more effectually to fasten on them the chains of commercial and financial bondage to the <name>North</name> and <name>East</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The <rs>West</rs> has so far succeeded as to have control of the river down to <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, while <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> (or rather <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>) controls from the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> to <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Therefore, the only remaining portion of the river not open to commerce is from <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> to <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The Yankee gun boat patrol renders it useless to us always, excepting some forlorn flatboat or skiff which the <rs>Yankees</rs> have not destroyed, and which our people use to ferry themselves over the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> The trade of the <rs>West</rs> down to <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> is but trilling, and, take away the attractions of a large army, amounts to almost nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>To make up for lost trade the <rs>Western</rs> people have resorted to robbing, stealing, and wantonly wasting everything in their pathway under the hallucination that after the war is over the <rs>Southern</rs> people will be compelled "to come to us and buy all these things over again." A Yankee idea to the cores, and I might <unclear>ay</unclear> it is not without its philosophy, for in too many instances it will prove true reasoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/><placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> holds the river, with New Orleans, to <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, and the only benefit derived is not from trade but from pillage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> Now, evacuate these places, and let the <rs>West</rs> use her steamboats to transport her produce South, instead of going to the <rs>East</rs> over the railroads around by <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and the northern capital, and what advantage has the <rs>West</rs> gained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The Southern people cannot trade with the <rs>West</rs>, because of its inability to pay for its produce in a proper currency.--There is not gold enough in the country &mdash; the people have been bankrupted by the robberies of their soldiers, and those who would buy cannot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Their plantations have been made desolate and the consumers carried away.--Their commerce will be fickle and precarious, for their boats and cargoes will be continually captured and destroyed; and to crown all, <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> has a capacious month, extended "wide open" to swallow up whatever may successfully run the gauntlet to New Orleans to supply a local market, some little shipment in the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mexico" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> In ordinary times the trade of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> alone was worth more to the <rs>West</rs> than will be all the trade of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and its tributaries with <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> in their possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Let the <rs>West</rs> have the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and still remain in arms against the <rs>South</rs>, and what will her trade be worth?--The question can be answered in a word &mdash; nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Then suppose the war continued, the <rs>West</rs> is paid in greenbacks and the coin husbanded in the <rs>North</rs>, while a debt is accumulated that will for ages grind her people with taxation, while the <name>North</name> and <name>East</name>, by their trickery, manage to indirectly collect their tax also from the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Remember that the <rs>West</rs> has pursued no conciliatory course towards the <rs>South</rs>, collectively or individually, and is therefore entitled to no sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Being naturally the ally of the <rs>South</rs>, <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> politicians have been too adroit in their management of affairs to permit any feelings of sympathy or friendship to be engendered, either politically, socially, collectively, individually, or religiously. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> The South can be damaged but very little more than she now is by the abandonment of these places, and the <rs>West</rs> can receive little or no benefit from the day that <placeName key="tgn,7017544" n="1.000 14" reg="port hudson, east baton rouge, louisiana">Port Hudson</placeName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> are abandoned than she now enjoys. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> It will be contended that to give up these places will encourage the <rs>West</rs> to renewed energy, and cause a procrastination of the war. This may be the case, but only for a little season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Not until then will the <rs>West</rs> realize the fact that she has lost her best cash customer and most true friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>It will then be as clear as "mud" to the <name>Hoosiers</name>, <persName n="Buck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Buck,nomatch:0"><surname>Buck</surname></persName> eyes and Suckers, that they have been befooled to such an extent as to cause them to turn on their deceivers in their wrath, and take full vengeance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Nothing is more true in the natural course of life than that no man, however great a fool he may be, likes to be told of it, and, moreover, used as an instrument in the bands of his more crafty and subtle neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Again, it may be urged that it would free a large portion of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, and thus enable the enemy to successfully carry out other expeditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>I think not, as it would require strong garrisons to hold all vulnerable, as well as strong points on the river, and, instead of holding so many, greatly reduce the <rs>Federal</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>In stating this fact we do not seek to justify the principle of repudiation, which is alike dishonorable in a nation or an individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>We speak of such a policy now as among the inevitable consequences of the lamentable condition in which the <rs>North</rs> finds itself after an Abolition crusade of over, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> After a defence which will be remembered as long as valor and patriotism continue to be objects of reverence among mankind, the heroic garrison of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> has been compelled to yield to the near prospect of starvation that which it never would have yielded to the prowess of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>No helping hand was stretched out to them in the hour of their need &mdash; no encouraging voice came to them from beyond the enemy's lines &mdash; not an effort was made to relieve them &mdash; not an attempt to afford them succor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Shut out from all hope, save in their own valor and the resources which lay within their lines, it was theirs, from day to day, and from hour to hour, to experience that dreary sinking of the heart which arises from hope deferred, when they knew that a friendly army was lying within sound of their cannon, and that relief or assistance was not to be expected from them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> We know not what may have been the situation of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>His friends complain that he was not sufficiently furnished with men and the munitions of war. He may not have had the half of the force which even the <rs>Yankee</rs> estimate places at his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>But this we do know, that <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was a place of the utmost importance, that its capture, to be followed, we presume, by the capture like wise of <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, reduces our cause in the <rs>Southwest</rs> to great difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Under such circumstances, it does appear to us that some <hi rend="italics">little</hi> risk might have been run, some attempt, however feeble, might have been made to relieve it. But <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> thought differently, and we suppose he is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Doubtless he thinks the same thing with regard to <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, and we may therefore make up our minds to a catastrophe in that quarter.--From all the information we can collect, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> never had more than <num value="60000">60,000</num> men around <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>He went there with that number, and was never able, with all his reinforcements, to swell his army to a larger size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The garrison had <num value="17000">17,000</num> men when they surrendered, and communication was constantly kept up with the army outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The force of the latter must have been deplorably small indeed, otherwise a combined attack would surely have been concerted and executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>For the honor of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, we cannot but wish this had been tried, even though it had been unsuccessful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The most mortifying part of the whole affair is, that the surrender was made, without a blow struck by the army without. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> The blow is severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>It is indeed a grievous <num value="1">one</num> to the whole Confederacy, which had learned not only to admire but to love <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Its gallant and successful defence for so many long months, against the concentrated assaults of so many gunboats, and finally of a combined attack of a large army in the rear, and a fleet of <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating batteries</orgName> in front, had impressed the public mind with the idea that it was invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Had it fallen directly after <placeName key="tgn,7017545" n="1.000 120" reg="natchez, adams, mississippi">Natchez</placeName>, as everybody expected, no <num value="1">one</num> would have been surprised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>But to the general surprise of all, it successfully defied and defeated the enemy, and had become our champion, our pride and our boast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Our heart and hope was with it. Its fate, however, was not unexpected by many; nor is it by any means irreparable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Not unexpected, for it was known in this city <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> ago that no attempt would be made to relieve the garrison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Not irreparable, for although it may not be as convenient for us to maintain the blockade of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> without <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> as with it, yet if our own army acts with the vigor the situation demands, the navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, so far from being restored, will be so completely blockaded that nothing but a gunboat can go from <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> or <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName> to New Orleans, and gunboats do not carry freight.
