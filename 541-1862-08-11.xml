<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>At that critical juncture of the affairs of the country, neither your petitioners nor the public had any idea of the passage of the <rs>Conscript Act</rs>. It was then believed that it was the settled policy of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> to rest its sustaining reliance on the untrammeled free will and high spirit of the <rs>Southern</rs> people to be called forth, organized, and put into action under their respective State organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Your petitioners could not have anticipated the passage of the <rs>Conscript Act</rs>, or the adoption and sanction of any system of military organization by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Government, which would claim to rest as a basis on the abnegation of the cherished principle of State sovereignty and individual freedom of will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>They, as did their States, regarded the cardinal principle of individual personal liberty and unquestioned State sovereignty as the keynote to the existing revolution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> Under impulses of no ordinary character, your petitioners, in the hour of their country's danger, left home, family, all, <hi rend="italics">to fight as freemen in the army of freemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/></hi> To preserve sacred their birth right &mdash; individual, personal liberty, under their respective State Governments &mdash; they were, and are now, prepared to sacrifice everything but their honor and manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>They believed, as they had every right to believe, that the agreed <hi rend="italics">status</hi> of the army would remain on the basis which had been adopted and sanctioned by the responsive legislation of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Had that ascertained policy and accredited system of military organization been sustained and carried out, not <num value="1">one</num> of your petitioners would have complained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> Under the conviction that no such charge would or could be made, your petitioners volunteered freely and re-enlisted willingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>They thus entered into a contract with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, which they had no right to suspect would ever be violated by that high-contracting party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>In this they were over-confident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>On <date value="1862-04-16">the 16th day of April, 1862,</date> the <rs>Conscript Act</rs> became a law. The will of your honorable body, as made known in that law, by terms too plain to be mistaken, and too imperious to be lightly disregarded, annulled all previous contracts made by volunteers, and by explicit terms of <hi rend="italics">coercive legislation,</hi> made men under the age of <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> and over <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure>, <hi rend="italics">soldiers for the war,</hi> or until they attained the age of <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure>--thus drawing, as with <q>"hooks of steel,"</q> every male citizen within the prescribed ages (with a few excepted cases) immediately and entirely from the control of State action, and placed them at the disposal of the <rs>President</rs> <hi rend="italics">during the war.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> This law, had it been unqualified and unaccompanied by a reciprocating return to the body of society, and under the control of the different States, (that class then in the army, represented by your petitioners,) could never have been sanctioned by the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>As a <hi rend="italics">bonus</hi> to society, and a concurrent guarantee to the <name>States</name>, your honorable body inserted certain qualifications, restrictions, and conditions precedent to the main body of the act.--<hi rend="italics">They</hi> were in the following words: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> <q>"<hi rend="italics">Provided, further,</hi> That all persons under the age of <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure> or over the age of <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure>, who are now enrolled in the military service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, in the regiments, squadrons, battalions, and companies hereafter to be re-organized, shall be required to remain in their respective companies, squadrons, battalions, and regiments for <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>, unless their places shall be sooner supplied by other recruits, not now in the service, who are between the ages of <num value="18">18</num> and <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure>. And all laws and parts of laws providing for the reorganization of volunteers, and the organization thereof, into companies, squadrons, battalions, and regiments, shall be, and the same are hereby, repealed."</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> On the promulgation of the law, with this qualification, (without which your petitioners aver the law could never have been passed,) there was but <num value="1">one</num> construction placed on it in the army and throughout the country, so far as your petitioners are advised and believe; and that was, that all persons over the age of <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> or under <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure>, who were, on the date of the law, <q>"enrolled in the military service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>,"</q> <hi rend="italics">should be discharged on <date value="1862-07-16">the 16th day of July, 1862; </date></hi> and this without restriction, qualification or peradventure.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> That order took the country and the army by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It fell as a death knell upon the assured expectations of your petitioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>It struck the popular our with no less astonishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It disclosed a new, secret, and dangerous spring of Executive and ministerial power, as unlooked for as it was novel and perilous to the spirit and genius of the revolution inaugurated on the declared principle of eternal opposition and unyielding resistance to Executive or <hi rend="italics">quest</hi> legislative encroachments on the chartered rights and constitutional privileges of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>It manifested a will to assume power where none was bestowed, or intended to be bestowed, and to exercise high retracting and annulling prerogatives where all exercise of Executive will or ministerial discretion was positively and distinctly inhibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It presented a painful instance of a plain, palpable and dangerous infraction of the constitutional guaranties and vested rights of your petitioners, as declared by your hon- </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> orable body, and unmistakably announced in the <rs>Conscript Act</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> Your petitioners feeling that this interpolating order of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs> was a clear, palpable, and unauthorized (<hi rend="italics">by the law</hi>) infraction of their rights, consulted counsel, and procured his written opinion, which was published, and will be laid before your honorable body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>In thus seeking counsel, your petitioners were not actuated by any other spirit than that of a disposition to ascertain their legal rights, as defined and enumerated by your honorable body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>They had <hi rend="italics">volunteered</hi> without the least idea of the passage of any such law. That law, without their solicitation, not only revoked and annulled the act of their volunteering, but, in distinct terms, released them from all military service after <date value="1862-07-16">the 16th day of July, 1862,</date> <hi rend="italics">as a consideration to society and the different States</hi> for the unconditional, peremptory, and mandatory draft, which the same law made indiscriminately on the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>It in express terms <hi rend="italics">released</hi> all over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> or under <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure>, that <hi rend="italics">it might claim, demand, and impress</hi> all between those ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>It <hi rend="italics">discarded</hi> those over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> of age, that it might Coerce those under that age. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/> This was a severe tax on the community at large, and not less severe on your petitioners as a class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It took the manhood and youth of the country, with or without their consent; but it undertook and guaranteed that all over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> or under <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure> should be discharged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>This was in terms, a solemn legislative compact with the <name>States</name> and society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>As such, severe and harsh as it was, it was ratified by acquiescence, and no settled opposition was made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/> You petitioners even now would greatly prefer that matters should have remained as they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>But they were disposed of by the law, and respectfully insist that what the law did the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> cannot undo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The compact made by your honorable body, if good in <num value="1">one</num> part, must stand unaltered in every part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The clause releasing your petitioners was in a proviso, and was and is paramount to the enactments in the main body of the act. It was the codicil to the legislative will, and was superior in its active powers to any and all parts of the act which might happen to conflict with it. If the retroactive interpolation entered by authority of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> repealed that proviso, according to all law and every rule of sound construction the same repealing order would annul and destroy the main body of the act. On this subject your petitioners are advised the authorities are most satisfactory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/> But the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> has repealed the proviso, recalled the warrant of discharge, and placed his own construction on the whole law, and directed that your petitioners should not be discharged &mdash; the <num value="12">twelve</num>-months' men &mdash; until the expiration of <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure> after their term of service, and claims to retain all persons enlisted for the war previous to <date value="1862-04-16">the 16th of April, 1862,</date> for the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> Your petitioners are advised that the rights, privileges, and immunities vested in them by virtue of the proviso to the said act, are full and complete, attended by no conditions and restrained by no qualifications, and that those rights admit of no intermediate and counteracting restrictions, either from the <rs>Executive</rs> or ministerial Department of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>They ever, most respectfully, that any interpolating or retroactive orders, whether by the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>, or any <num value="1">one</num> or more of his subordinate, functionaries, is in law (however they may temporarily act on your petitioners) unavailing, null and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>But they are advised that, as there is in operation no judicial process by which they could test this matter as a class, their only legitimate means of redress is through your honorable body. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> There can be no question that <hi rend="italics">all</hi> laws passed by Congress are <hi rend="italics">supreme,</hi> and challenge the <hi rend="italics">obedient acquiescence</hi> of the <rs>President</rs> and every Department of the <rs>Government</rs>, until they are repealed or pronounced unconstitutional by a competent judicial tribunal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>And any violation of any <num value="1">one</num> or more of such laws by any Department of the <rs>Government</rs>, is not less culpable than a similar violation by any other member of society. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> The reason spirit, and intention of the law in question, as well as its words, context, and subject matter, are plain and unmistakable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>There is no point, no word, no object, no purpose, which is not fairly and plainly set forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The question then presents itself, painful, serious and vital, shall the law prevail, or shall the intervening, unauthorized interpolation of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> prevail?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Shall an army order revoke a solemn act of Congress?--Shall Congress or the <rs>Executive</rs> rule the people control the army, and legislate for the country? --Have we a constitutional Government, with specific powers granted, beyond which no department of the <rs>Government</rs> shall pass, or have we an unlimited Government, dependent only on Executive will or ministerial caprice?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/><hi rend="italics">Are the <name>People</name> free or is the <rs>Executive</rs> supreme?</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/> These are no idle questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>They are solemnly propounded, and merit a solemn response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>It was legislative encroachments and Executive usurpations which destroyed the <rs>Union</rs>, never to be restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Shall the <rs>Southern States</rs>, confederated, yield the same destroying element of self- destruction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The answer which your honorable body may see fit to give will descend with its weighty consequences to posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The voice of history is not less potent in its warnings against Executive assumption or ministerial abuse of power than the hopes of the future are dependent on your response. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> In view of the dangers which beset the country, your petitioners cannot better conclude their appeal than by adopting the significant language uttered by <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, in the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName>, on <date value="1788-01-07">the 7th January, 1788.</date> when he exclaimed: <q>"The real rock of political salvation is self-love &mdash; perpetuated from age to age &mdash; in every human breast, and manifested in every human action.--When the commons of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, in the manly language which became freemen, said to their king, <hi rend="smallcaps">You are our servant,</hi>--then was the temple of liberty complete. "</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> It is with no view of avoiding danger, or shunning responsibilities; that your petitioners ask their discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Their hearts, hopes, energies, are all enlisted in this war. They had rather lose all and perish themselves, than fail to maintain the cardinal principle on which this war turns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>They will never yield to an insolent foreign foe, or succumb to any power which seeks to subvert the inherent rights of the <name>States</name> or to destroy the individual liberty of the free-born citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Feeling that in this order of revocation, (<rs n="General Order" type="misc">General Order</rs>, <num value="46">No. 46</num>.) not only their rights, but the rights of the people, and the legitimate powers and functions of Congress, are invaded and endangered, they seek the proper remedy; should their services be needed, they, and all they have, will be freely offered up on the altar of constitutional liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>But they are not prepared to yield a silent submission to the violation of their rights or the subversion of the vested immunities, when their <hi rend="italics">title papers are derived from your honorable body.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> Your petitioners respectfully ask, that they may be fully heard before your honorable body, through their counsel.
