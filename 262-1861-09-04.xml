<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> Your welcome letter reached me <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> after date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>I have been away a week, and so I have <hi rend="italics">seemed</hi> to be neglectful of your epistle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> I was very glad to hear from you. I have thought frequently of you since we parted in <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName>, after the purchase of that knife and revolver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>If a bullet from the latter had been honored in a lodgment in the assassin <rs>Jackson</rs>'s vile carcase, it would have been a pleasant piece of information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I am very much afraid your boys are not to have a serious brush with the rebels within the unfortunate <hi rend="italics"><measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure></hi> of enlistment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It will be a <hi rend="italics">dry rain</hi> with them if they make a return march up <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName> without having had a real grand tug with the ice. It will be like running the <hi rend="italics">machine </hi> to a fire and finding the fire out. I hope, for their own sakes, they will have a chance to do a <hi rend="italics">big thing</hi> with those infernal traitors before they get home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> I wish I could run down and see you. It would be delightful to see the boys in <hi rend="italics">fierce array, spilin' for a fight,</hi> and no fight at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We have great confidence in <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName></hi> up here; and we have confidence in <hi rend="italics">prompt measures,</hi> too. There are some rebel batteries a little too close to Federal lines to make it particularly honorable or creditable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>I think the boys would like to take some of these posts by contract, and give good security for the prompt performance of all engagements, and assume all the risk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>I do not know but that wars generally could more rapidly and completely he disposed of under the contract system than in the old-fashioned way. All the munitions of war, as well as the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">Commissary Department</orgName>, are under the contract system, and you get gloriously cheated and sold out generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Suppose you are permitted to look out for your own provender, and do up the rebellion at so much for the job. I think in that case the rebel Congress would never meet in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>And wouldn't the <rs>Fire Zouaves</rs> <q>"be there to see,"</q> and have a big finger in that pie?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Methinks so. Do you think it would be worth while to correspond with <persName n="Scott,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Scott,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> on the subject?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Hadn't you all better stay till you wipe the thing clean, and then for once tell your children a tale that the angels would love to listen to ? I suppose if you would only put a dozen bullets through some contractors and commissaries, you would be more happy than you are. Some of them, at least, ought to be sent down the <rs>Potomac</rs> astride of a log. It is unpardonable that, when <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men have patriotically laid themselves on the altar of their country, a few graceless, soulless scoundrels should disaffect a whole army by their diabolical contract villainy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>A member of <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Duryea,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Duryea,nomatch:0"><surname>Duryea</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName> told me the other day, he had not had <measure n="30cents" type="currency">30 cents</measure>' worth of provisions in a week, in the face of the fact that Government allows <measure n="30cents" type="currency">30 cents</measure>' per day for each man. The unmitigated wretches that cause such a state of things are a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times worse than open traitors fighting in the rebel army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I wish you could give them all a fair hanging, and hold a court-martial in their case afterward. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> What has become of <hi rend="italics">compromise</hi> down your way?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Part of the money ought to be expended in erecting a continuous gallows around the <rs>Capitol</rs> grounds, to be thickly strange with head rebels, from Jeff., the arch traitor, down to the microscopic <rs>Twiggs</rs>, the most contemptible of them all. Tell the boys &mdash; do hold on; a few more pork rations and hard crackers, and you will have the pleasure of opening up avenues through the ranks of the fighting rebels, and hearing prayers under the scaffold of traitors of the upper <num value="10">ten</num>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> Never was there a war in which the people of this country took a greater interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>We watch with the utmost solicitude all proceedings of the belligerents, and observe not only the operations of their armies, but the manifestation of popular feeling, with sentiments which no other struggle could excite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>We can say more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Though it is impossible to avoid reflecting that the division of the <rs>Union</rs> into <num value="2">two</num> great States may relieve as from many of the troubles with which we were menaced by the overbearing policy of the old <rs>Federal Government</rs>, we can safety assert that Englishmen desire nothing more than to see the quarrel terminated and the strife appeased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>We wish no harm to either party, and would far rather see <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> strong, united and prosperous than speculate on the advantages which its premature disruption might possibly bring to its neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>But when we have said this we have said all that the <rs>Americans</rs> are likely to hear with much satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>For the rest, our conclusions are certainly not favorable to those institutions under which this great catastrophe has been matured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>What the <rs>Americans</rs> call freedom, but what we call democracy, does not show to advantage at this critical time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>The theories attributing immeasurable superiority to republican forms of government, have all been falsified in the plainest and most striking manner, and the last <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> has proved beyond all question that the preponderance of popular will without check or limit is at least as likely to hurry a nation into war and debt as the caprice of the most absolute despot or the intrigues of the most selfish of aristocracies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> We are not finding fault with the <rs>Northern States</rs> for going to war. We have repeatedly admitted that the <orgName n="Federal party" type="party">Federal party</orgName> could not be expected to view the dismemberment of the <rs>Union</rs> without an effort to avert the loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>But, though civil war is the most frightful of all wars, the <rs>Americans</rs> plunged into it with less concern than would have been shown by any European State in adopting a diplomatic quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Though the people of the <rs>South</rs> were of the same flesh and blood with the people of the <rs>North</rs>, and connected with them by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> links of interest and feeling, the <name>Northerners</name> instantly heaped every conceivable opprobrium on the heads of the <name>Southerners</name>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>It is this, if the <rs>Americans</rs> wish to know the truth, which points the remarks of Englishmen on their civil war and its incidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>It is not that they are any worse or more foolish or more intemperate than was to be expected under the trials to which they have been exposed, but that they have been held up to our admiration by a certain party among us as a people in whose counsels no intemperance or folly would ever be likely to prevail.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> We know not where to find a parallel to this proclamation, except in that issued by the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Brunswick, Glynn, Georgia" key="tgn,2022283">Brunswick</placeName>, upon his invasion of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct>, for the purpose of putting down the revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>That proclamation has received the execration of the whole civilized world, and it will continue to receive it, as long as any portion of the world remains civilised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It threatened with death all Frenchmen who should be taken with arms in their hands, taken up for the purpose of defending their native soil against invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>This is exactly what <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName></hi> threatens to the citizens of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>There was this excuse for the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Brunswick, Glynn, Georgia" key="tgn,2022283">Brunswick</placeName>; he was an absolute monarch, and a General in the service of an absolute monarch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>He had been taught to be have from his childhood, that the monarch derived his claim to rule directly from Heaven, and that rebellion against him was rebellion against <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>His opinion was, that the country and the people belonged in every instance to the <rs>King</rs> or <rs>Emperor</rs> or reigning <persName n="Duke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Duke,nomatch:0"><surname>Duke</surname></persName>, as the case might be, and that they enjoyed the privilege of breathing only by sufferance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>He had, probably, never heard of popular rights, or conceived that such things ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The doctrine that all power is derived from the people, and must be exercised only for their benefit, must have been heard by him for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time since the commencement of the revolution in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, although he had married a sister of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName></hi> Ill, He, doubtless, regarded the revolutionists of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> as rebels against the <rs>Most High</rs>, and supposed it to be the duty of every good Christian to exterminate them with fire and sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>There was some palpitation, therefore, for the atrocious document which he put forth upon this occasion, the sentiments of which all the courts of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> made haste to disavow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> But <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName></hi> and his adviser can offer no such excuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>They were raised in a country professing to be governed by a Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>They have, no doubt, read that Constitution, and they know that in proclamation martial law, and shooting men for no other offence than taking up arms to defend their country against invaders, they utterly overturn it from its very foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>They know that nobody but Congress can proclaim martial law, and that Congress can only do it under certain definite restrictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The name of <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Brunswick, Glynn, Georgia" key="tgn,2022283">Brunswick</placeName></hi> has come down to posterity loaded with the curses of <num value="1000000">millions</num>, who regard him as an enemy of human rights and the human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It the serious events with which they are connected should prove able to save the actors in this farcical tragedy, or tragical farce, from that oblivion which is the usual, as it is the best reward of small men, what will posterity say of them? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> Will <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName></hi> carry his threat into execution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Will he murder the prisoners that may fall into his hands?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Will he assassinate the patriots whom he may happen to detect in the act of defending their country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>We have no doubt he would do it if he dared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>But he dare not. His proclamation is mere brute thunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>There is not a spark of the electric fluid in it. He knows that we would retaliate, and he dare not risk the trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>In the meantime his proclamation will have the same effect that <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Brunswick, Glynn, Georgia" key="tgn,2022283">Brunswick</placeName>'s</hi> proclamation had upon <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>It will arouse the whole population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It will confirm the wavering, and drive the most resolute Union men into our ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>His declaring free the negroes of all <q> "rebels,"</q> (as the tools of power habitually call all patriots,) will alienate the whole native population, not only of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> but of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> also. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>The reader will not fall to note the construction of its language &mdash; the attempt to deceive the ignorant in regard to the circumstances of a war in reality waged upon the <rs>South</rs> by the wicked Abolition Administration: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/> Your National Government, compelled by a guilty conspiracy, culminating in causeless insurrection, is engaged in war for the <name>Security</name> of Liberty, for the <name>Supremacy</name> of Law; for the defence of Union, and for the maintenance of Popular Institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>For means to defray the necessary expenses of this war, your Congress has directed that an appeal be made to you, by opening a subscription to a National Loan of <num value="150000000">one hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/> Already the enlightened and patriotic capitalists of the great cities of New York, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> have manifested their clear sense both of duty, and interest, by the subscription of <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> of dollars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/> The Act of Congress under which this subscription was received wisely provides, however, that the advantages as well as the patriotic satisfaction of participation in this loan shall be offered, not to the capitalists of the great cities only, but to the people of the whole country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/> In order to secure a substantial reward for their public spirit to those whose patriotism prompts them, in this hour of trial, to place their means at the disposal of the <rs>Government</rs>, Congress has directed that an interest of <num value="7">seven</num> and <num value="3">three</num>-<num value="0.001">tenths per centum</num> be paid on the several amounts subscribed; an interest not liable to State taxation, but constituting for the subscribers a revenue, not only certain in receipt, but greater in amount than can be expected from any ordinary investment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/> And, in order to afford to all citizens equal opportunities of participating in these advantages, Congress has further directed that subscriptions be received for sums as small as <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure>, as well as for larger amounts; and that should the subscriptions exceed the whole sum desired, the smaller be preferred in the distribution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/> Each subscriber, on payment of his subscription, will be entitled to receive Treasury notes of equal amount in such denominations as he may prefer, whether of <num value="50">fifty</num>, <num value="100">one hundred</num>, <num value="500">five hundred</num>, <num value="1000">one thousand</num>, or <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">five thousand dollars</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/> The interest, at T <num value="3">3</num> <num value="10">10</num> per annum, will be on notes of <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure>, <num value="1">one</num> cent; on <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure>, <measure n="2cents" type="currency">two cents</measure>; on <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure>, <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure>; on <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure>, <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> <measure n="20cents" type="currency">twenty cents</measure>; and on <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">five thousand dollars</measure>, <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> each day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/> All Treasury notes issued will bear date on the <date value="1861-08-19">19th of August, 1861, </date> and will carry interest from that date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>Each note will have coupons attached, expressing the several amounts of semi-annual interest, which coupons may be detached from the note and presented for payment separately. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/> Each subscriber may pay the whole amount subscribed at the time of subscription, or if he prefers to do so, may pay <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> at that time and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> every <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> day there after.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/> In order to secure, beyond peradventure, the punctual payment of interest and the gradual reduction of the principal, congress has provided by law for an annual revenue amply sufficient not only for these purposes, but for the prompt payment of all demands on account of ordinary expenditures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/> It will be seen at a glance, that not only is the whole property of the country pledged for the interest and final reimbursement of this loan, but that an adequate specific proportion of the annual production is set apart, by taxation, for the redemption of this pledge.--Prompt payment, beyond contingency, is thus ensured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/> Nor can this taxation be thought great, when compared with the magnitude of the objects of the contest, or with the amount of property and production. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/> The objects are Union, popular government, permanent peace, security at home, respect abroad; all imperiled by unprovoked rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/> And the means for the attainment of these great objects can be readily supplied from the property and production of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>The real and personal values in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> reach the vast aggregate of <num value="16000">sixteen thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars; and in the <name>States</name> now loyal to the <rs>Union</rs> this aggregate is <num value="11000">eleven thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/> The yearly surplus earnings of the loyal people are estimated, by Intelligent persons conversant with such investigations, at more than <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of dollars; while the well considered judgments of military men of the highest rank and repute, warrant a confident expectation that the war, prosecuted with energy, courage and skill, may be brought to a termination before the close of the next spring; in which event the cost, beyond the revenue, will hardly exceed the amount of the <num value="250000000">two hundred and fifty millions</num> loan authorized by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>With due economy in all branches of the public service, the total expenditures for all objects, military, naval and civil, in this year of war, need not exceed the ordinary expenditures of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> in years of peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/> And is it unreasonable to hope that the auspicious result of peace may be hastened by the reflections of the citizens of the <name>States</name> is insurrection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>That they will review their action; weigh their own welfare; consider the disposition of the people of the whole county to recognize all their constitutional rights and to allow them their full share in the benefits of the common Government, and renew their allegiance to the <rs>Union</rs>, which, in an evil hour, they have been tempted to throw off?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Will they not reflect that the war into which the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>Union</rs> has been constrained is not a war for their subjugation, but a war for national existence, and that an auspicious result to the <rs>Union</rs> will benefit as largely the <name>States</name> in insurrection as the <name>States</name> which have remained loyal? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/> However this may be, the duty of the <rs>National Government</rs>, as the constitutionally constituted agent of the people, admits of no question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>The war, made necessary by insurrection, and reluctantly accepted by the <rs>Government</rs>, must be prosecuted with all possible vigor until the restoration of the just authority of the <rs>Union</rs> shall insure permanent peace. </p>

<p> That there is great extortion daily practiced by the driver of hacks, especially on strangers visiting this city, and much insolence on the part of drivers, there is no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>To prevent this as far as possible, positive instructions have been given to the <name>Police</name> to summon every violator of the ordinance to this office, to answer for the offence in the most summary manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>Its penalties will be rigidly enforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>Put many offences must necessarily go unpunished unless those upon whom imposition and extortion are practiced, will give information at this office of the offender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>This can be done by taking notice of and furnishing the No. of the hack; and, to this extent I invoke the aid of the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>The necessity of this is at once obvious, as it is idle to give information of an offence without some clue to the offender.--The so (required to be on every hack) will certainly disclose the owner as well as driver.--That those concerned may take heed, it is repeated that the highest penalties of the ordinance will be enforced against all who shall violate its provisions.
