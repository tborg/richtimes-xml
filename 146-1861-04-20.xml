<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He sees in them, not a rightful and accomplished revolution and an independent nation, with an established government, but rather a perversion of a temporary and partisan excitement to the inconsiderate purposes of an unjustifiable and unconstitutional aggression upon the rights and the authority vested in the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and hitherto benignly exercised, as from their very nature they always must be so exercised, for the maintenance of the <rs>Union</rs>, the preservation of liberty, and the security, peace, welfare, happiness and aggrandizement of the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, therefore, avows to <persName n="Forsyth,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Forsyth,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Forsyth</surname></persName> and <persName n="Crawford,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Crawford,Martin,J.,,"><roleName n="Mister"/><surname>Crawford</surname></persName> that he looks patiently but confidently for the cure of evils which have resulted from proceedings so unnecessary, so unwise, so unusual and so unnatural, not to irregular negotiations, having in view new and untried relations with agencies unknown to and acting in derogation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws, but to regular and considerate action of the people of those States, in cooperation with their brethren in the other States, through the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, and such extraordinary conventions, if there shall be need thereof, as the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> contemplates and authorizes to be assembled. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> In that memorandum you correctly state the purport of the official note addressed to you by the undersigned on the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="12">12th ultimo</day></dateStruct>.--Without repeating the contents of that note in full, it is enough to say here that its object was to invite the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to a friendly consideration of the relations between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the <num value="7">seven</num> States lately of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, but now separated from it by the sovereign will of their people, growing out of the pregnant and undeniable fact that those people have rejected the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and established a government of their own. Those relations had to be friendly or hostile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The people of the old and new governments, occupying <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> contiguous territories, had to stand to each other in the relation of good neighbors, each seeking their happiness and planing their national destinies in their own way, without interference with the other, or they had to be rival and hostile nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had no hesitation in electing its choice in this alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Frankly and unreservedly, seeking the good of the people who had entrusted them with power, in the spirit of humanity, of the <rs>Christian</rs> civilization of the age, and of that Americanism which regards the true welfare and happiness of the people, the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, among its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts, commissioned the undersigned to approach the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with the olive branch of peace, and to offer to adjust the great questions pending between them in the only way to be justified by the consciences and common sense of good men who had nothing but the welfare of the people of the <num value="2">two</num> Confederacies at heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> Your Government has not chosen to meet the undersigned in the conciliatory and peaceful spirit in which they are commissioned.--Persistently wedded to those fatal theories of construction of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> always rejected by the statesmen of the <rs>South</rs>, and adhered to by those of the <rs type="place">Administration school</rs>, until they have produced their natural and often predicted result of the destruction of the <rs>Union</rs>, under which we might have continued to live happily and gloriously together had the spirit of the ancestry who framed the common Constitution animated the hearts of all their sons, you now, with a persistence untaught and uncured by the ruin which has been wrought, refuse to recognize the great fact presented to you of a completed and successful revolution; you close your eyes to the existence of the <rs>Government</rs> founded upon it, and ignore the high duties of moderation and humanity which attach to you in dealing with this great fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Had you met these issues with the frankness and manliness with which the undersigned were instructed to present them to you and treat them, the undersigned had not now the melancholy duty to return home and tell their Government and their countrymen that their earnest and ceaseless efforts in behalf of peace had been futile, and that the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> meant to subjugate them by force of arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Whatever may be the result, impartial history will record the innocence of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and place the responsibility of the blood and mourning that may ensue upon those who have denied the great fundamental doctrine of American liberty, that " Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and who have set naval and land armaments in motion to subject the people of <num value="1">one</num> portion of this land to the will of another portion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>That that can never be done while a freeman survives in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to wield a weapon, the undersigned appeal to past history to prove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>These military demonstrations against the people of the seceded States are certainly far from being in keeping and consistency with the theory of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, maintained in his memorandum, that these States are still component parts of the late <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>, as the undersigned are not aware of any constitutional power in the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to levy war, without the consent of Congress, upon a foreign people, much less upon any portion of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The undersigned, like the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, have no purpose to <q>"invite or engage in discussion"</q> of the subject on which their <num value="2">two</num> Governments are so irreconcilably at variance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It is this variance that has broken up the old Union, the disintegration of which has only begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It is proper, however, to advise you that it were well to dismiss the hopes you seem to entertain that, by any of the modes indicated, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will ever be brought to submit to the authority of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>You are dealing with delusions, too, when you seek to separate our people from our Government and to characterize the deliberate, sovereign act of that people as a <q>"perversion of a temporary and partizan excitement."</q> If you cherish these dreams you will be awakened from them and find them as unreal and unsubstantial as others in which you have recently indulged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The undersigned would omit the performance of an obvious duty were they to fail to make known to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have declared their independence with a full knowledge of all the responsibilities of that act, and with as firm a determination to maintain it by all the means with which nature has endowed them as that which sustained their fathers when they threw off the authority of the <rs>British</rs> crown. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The undersigned clearly understand that you have declined to appoint a day to enable them to lay the objects of the mission with which they are charged before the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, because so to do would be to recognize the independence and separate nationality of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>This is the vein of thought that pervades the memorandum before us. The truth of history requires that it should distinctly appear upon the record that the undersigned did not ask the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to recognize the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>They only asked audience to adjust, in a spirit of amity and peace, the new relations springing from a manifest and accomplished revolution in the government of the late <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Your refusal to entertain these overtures for a peaceful solution, the active naval and military preparation of this Government, and a formal notice to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs> of the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName> in the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> that the <rs>President</rs> intends to provision <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> by forcible means, if necessary, are viewed by the undersigned, and can only be received by the world, as a declaration of war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>; for the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> knows that <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> cannot be provisioned without the effusion of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The undersigned, in behalf of their Government and people, accept the gage of battle thus thrown down to them, and, appealing to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the judgment of mankind for the righteousness of their cause, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will defend their liberties to the last against this flagrant and open attempt at their subjugation to sectional power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> This communication cannot be properly closed without adverting to the date of your memorandum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The official note of the undersigned, of the <date value="03-12">12th March,</date> was delivered to the <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of State">Assistant Secretary of State</rs> on the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="2">13th</day></dateStruct> of that month, the gentleman who delivered it informing him that the <rs>Secretary</rs> of this commission would call at <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time>, <time value="12:00pm">noon</time>, on the next day, for an answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Why this was not done it is proper should be here explained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The memorandum is dated <date value="03-15">March 15,</date> and was not delivered until <date value="04-08">April 8.</date> Why was it withheld during the intervening <measure n="23days" type="date">twenty- three days</measure>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>There was no suggestion of a reinforcement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The undersigned did not hesitate to believe that these assurances expressed the intentions of the <name>Administration</name> at the time, or at all event of prominent members of the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>This delay was assented to for the express purpose of attaining the great end of the mission of the undersigned, to wit: A pacific solution of existing complications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The inference deducible from the date of your memorandum, that the undersigned had, of their own volition and without cause, consented to this long hiatus in the grave duties with which they were charged, is therefore not consistent with a just exposition of the facts of the case. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> The Abolition imposture originated in, and has grown and thrived upon, deluding the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The last phase of this delusion is perhaps the most insidious and hypocritical of any that have preceded it. A party that has denounced the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> for years &mdash; which, in all our wars, has never shown the slightest attachment to the <rs>American</rs> flag, now all at once assumes to be its especial guardian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>And strange to say, Democrats have been deluded by the arch machinations of these destroyers of our country &mdash; these worse than madmen, who talk about preserving the <rs>Union</rs> by fighting for it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Are the people stark mad?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Are they crazy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Will they not pause and listen to reason?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Let us recur to a few facts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> Not long since, a <orgName n="Democratic Convention" type="convention">Democratic Convention</orgName> was held at <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>It was just after our people had been frightened by "a big scare" gotten up by <persName n="Smalley,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Smalley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Smalley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>That Convention solemnly pledged the <name>Democracy</name> and Union men of this State to oppose coercion, and demanded that the <name>Republicans</name> should either grant some reasonable compromise to the <rs>South</rs>, or else that <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>'s compromise amendments should be submitted to a vote of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>If the <name>Republicans</name> failed to do this, that Convention solemnly pledged itself to resist, with all their influence, the coercive policy of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:2"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> Where are these men now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>We trust the <rs>Convention</rs> will at once be called together, and let us see whether these men are now ready to join hands with the <name>Abolitionists</name> in tearing down this Government, or whether they still stand true to their pledges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Are they still ready to say <q>"if the <name>Republicans</name> desire to fight the <rs>South</rs>, let them do it, but we will have none of this bloody work?"</q>--Or are they weakly bending before the storm of Puritanical intolerance and bullism like that which silenced the men who protested against the delusions of witchcraft? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> Why this sudden change which, the <name>Republicans</name> papers say, has taken place?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, we do not believe it is half as general as they say; but what reason is there for any change?--Let us look at this <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> matter stripped of all its disguise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>We have no doubt, and all the circumstances prove, that it was a cunningly devised scheme, contrived with all due attention to scenic display and intended to arouse, and, if possible, exasperate the <rs>Northern</rs> people against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/></hi> Hence it was made in the way that enabled them to get up a story about <q>"humanity, "</q> <q>"relieving a starving garrison,"</q> &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Blind, deluded people!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>don't you know that should this party, even by accident, do <num value="1">one</num> noble, patriotic act, it would at once repent of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>By means of the excitement thus created, they have ensnared a few patriotic but thoughtless young men in New York, who love (very properly and very rightly) the <rs>American</rs> flag and its glorious associations, and hope by this means to enlist them in a fight for the <rs>Chicago</rs> platform; for that is all there is of this war. It is simply the <name>Republicans</name> <hi rend="italics">fighting for the unconstitutional <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> platform.</hi> If they will consent to abandon their opposition to the <rs>Constitution</rs> of their country: if they will agree to live under it and obey it in its spirit and letter, we might have peace to-morrow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> By means, therefore, of their cunning strategy at <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, they hope to induce Democrats to fight for that platform, while they cry out, <q>"come, defend the stars and stripes.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> We venture to say a more gigantic conspiracy against the principles of human liberty and freedom has never been concocted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Who but a fiend could have thought of sacrificing the gallant <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Robert,,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> and his little band in order to carry out a political game?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Why did they not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Perhaps the archives at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> will yet tell the tale of this strange proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>If the <name>South Carolinians</name> had been as bloodthirsty as the conceivers of this plot, the country might now have been shocked with the slaughter of every man in that fatal enclosure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> Democrats! will you, can you be led away by such transparent devices?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Republicans!--for we know many of you are opposed to this unnecessary and unjust war &mdash; will <hi rend="italics">you</hi> be driven by reckless leaders and politicians into supporting such atrocious acts? </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/> The events of the day have been such as to render me almost unable to decide where to begin an enumeration of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>The excitement has certainly reached its climax, and events of the most extraordinary character would now be received with nothing more than comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>The prime cause, however, of the tremendous display of feeling to-day, was the seizure of the <num value="3">three</num> vessels at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>The originators of the plan to take possession of these vessels were certainly very ingenious, as well in the conception as in the management and execution of it. It was done almost secretly, I may say, for very few persons here had any idea of such a thing; and when the news of the success of the enterprise reached the city, the majority of our citizens were completely astounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>A company of <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> men, commanded by <persName n="Brockett,Colonel,E.,L.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00436" reg="default:Brockett,E.,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Brockett</surname></persName>, assisted by about an equal number from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, headed by <persName n="Akin,Captain,Albert,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00437" reg="default:Akin,Albert,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>Albert</foreName> <surname>Akin</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,1002467">Henrico county</placeName>, were all that participated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Argo,</rs> from <placeName reg="Bath, Sagadahoc, Maine" key="tgn,7015765">Bath, Maine</placeName>, was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>She is a large vessel, being of <num value="1080">1,080</num> tons burthen, and will undoubtedly render good service, with an outlay of a small sum of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>No resistance was offered, though the officers thought it a little hard that they should so suddenly be deprived of their command, and consequently of their means of support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Part of her crew, consisting of <num value="18">eighteen</num> negroes, from different portions of the <rs>North</rs>, were put under arrest, and brought to this city and lodged in jail &mdash; What disposition will be made of them I am not able to say, but I presume they will not be harmed, as <persName n="Brockett,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00438" reg="nearbymention:Brockett,E.,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Brockett</surname></persName> pledged his word that they should not be troubled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>They will be brought before the <rs>Mayor</rs> to-morrow morning, and of course I shall keep you advised about them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/> A U. S. surveying vessel was next boarded and seized, and a sufficient force left upon her, as well as on the <rs>Argo</rs>, to protect and hold them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/> The seizure of the <rs>Jamestown</rs> was accidental altogether, she happening to reach the wharf before the <rs>Petersburg</rs> train left, which would have brought all but the force necessary to guard the captured vessels, to this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>The <rs>Jamestown</rs> created general admiration as she proudly neared the landing, with her flags floating gaily to the breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Nothing was said or done until she was firmly fastened to her moorings, when <persName n="Brockett,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00439" reg="nearbymention:Brockett,E.,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Brockett</surname></persName> politely informed <persName n="Skinner,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00440" reg="mostcommon:Skinner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Skinner</surname></persName> of his intention to detain and take possession of her also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>Objection was made by the gentlemanly <rs>Captain</rs>, and a threat was made that he should clear away and proceed immediately back to New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>But, by this time, he found his ship being fastened by other hands than his own, and seeing it was to no purpose to longer object, he reluctantly yielded, and Col. B. assumed the command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>Arrangements were then made for the steamer to proceed on her regular route to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, where I resign her further disposal to you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/> Flags have been floating from many residences and public buildings to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>A party ascended to the top of the new <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">Post-Office</orgName> and flung a large and beautiful Southern flag to the breeze, in the presence of an immense assemblage of persons, who, already wild with excitement, cheered and hurrahs till their throats were hoarse. </p> 
<p>
