<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> "Bury me at <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName>, in the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs>."

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Nothing marks the spot where his mortal remains lie to distinguish his grave from that of others save a diminutive Confederate flag not larger than a lady's kerchief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This tiny emblem is fastened to a staff not more than <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> long, and placed at the head of the grave, and there waves as if to illustrate the modest pretensions of the great hero of the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Close by his side a small grave is to be seen, which contains the remains of his child, who died a few years ago, and not far distant is the grave of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wife, "<persName><foreName>Elinor</foreName></persName>, the daughter of <persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Junkin,,Julia,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Junkin,Julia,,,"><foreName>Julia</foreName> <surname>Junkin</surname></persName>," with a plain marble slab at the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>His late residence is situated near the centre of town, and, like everything else planned by him, is modest and unpretending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It contains about <num value="2500">2,500</num> inhabitants, and is located, as is well known to most of your readers, in the most fertile and healthy section of the <rs>State</rs>, combining as it does natural beauty of scenery, together with the elegant style of the many splendid residences which are to be seen in and around the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It is also <num value="1">one</num> of the principal seats of literature in the <rs>South</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The Ann Smith Academy, for the instruction of females, is another institution of note, and is well conducted, deserving the liberal patronage which it receives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Like nearly all the residences in the town, they are remarkable for their neat and elegant appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It is a fact worthy of note that there cannot be found a dilapidated building within the town limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>As an illustration of the morals of the place, it may be stated that I have been informed by <num value="1">one</num> of the "oldest inhabitants" that he never has yet heard of a robbery being committed in the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>There is now very little business doing, and only <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> stores seem to have any goods, and these are scantily furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Every man appears to be living, as it were, "on his own hook." Productive gardens are attached to nearly every house, which relieves the inhabitants of the imposition practiced by Lucksters and market men on us unfortunates of the crowded cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>There are very few, if any, indigent persons here, and but few speculators in the necessaries of life who are residents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/><placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName> and the counties around are, however, favored by a number of speculators, &amp;c., from abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The former city, however, has the reputation of having furnished the larger number who trade in this section, and all that need be done on arrival here is to register your name and write <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> opposite, and you are set down as a merciless extortioner and hell-deserving speculator at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Something might be said of the home of your correspondent, but knowing, as he does, that there are a number of his fellow-townsmen who have been guilty of the crimes alleged, he will leave those guilty the task of defending themselves. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It is also stated that steps will be taken to put a stop to speculating in the necessaries of life within the county; but our <placeName key="tgn,2002186" n="1.000 7" reg="rockbridge, virginia, united states">Rockbridge</placeName> friends will find in this that "<persName n="Jordan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Jordan,nomatch:0"><surname>Jordan</surname></persName> is really a hard road to travel," unless they will tar and feather every man who is caught at the nefarious practice.
