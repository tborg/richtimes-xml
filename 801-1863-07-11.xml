<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The existing cartel, owing to these disagreements, is virtually suspended, so far as the exchange of officers on either side is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Deeply impressed as I was with these views and feelings, in undertaking the mission, and asking the conference, I can but express my profound regret at the result of the effort made to obtain it; and I can but entertain the belief, that if the conference sought had <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> been granted, mutual good could have been effected by it, and if this war, so unnatural, so unjust, so unchristian, and so inconsistent with every fundamental principle of American constitutional liberty, "must needs" continue to be waged against us, that at least some of its severer horrors, which now examining threaten might have been avoided. </p> <closer> <salute>Very respectfully,</salute> <signed><persName n="Stephens,,Alexander,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="default:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName>  <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4>

Without administering a grain of medicine, he ordered a thorough (wet) cupping to the pestering part of the head and along the spine, following it up with ice applications to the same extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The patient, of course, had to lay on his stomach, and was, well secured by mechanical constraint during this treatment, which was continued unabated without interruption for <num value="3">three</num> successive days and nights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The patient was protected against any return of paroxysm &mdash; His pulse and breathing became quiet, the price gradually left him, and isolated muscular twitching became likewise extinct. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> The case has naturally created much interest throughout the city, and the results of the treatment have been looked for with more than ordinary anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>It must be added that in some points the case differs from the ordinary experience, as we understand the shortest period heretofore observed between the inoculation of the hydrophobic prisons and the manifestation of the disease has been several days, whereas the present commenced <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure> after the bite. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> Inasmuch, however, as the <name>Burch</name> case has been seen by quite a number of reliable persons, and by highly competent physicians, objections to its reality on the ground of time can scarcely be permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>It is yet questionable whether the treatment resorted to in this case by <persName n="Bauer,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="nearbymention:Bauer,Louis,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Bauer</surname></persName> will be as efficacious in its results in similar cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>At any rate, this method will commend itself to the attention of the profession and the public at large, and future trials must decide its unfailing reliability. </p> </q><!--<bibl n="The Brooklyn (New York)"></bibl>--></cit> </div3> </div2> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/>
