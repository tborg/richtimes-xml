<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>We rather fancy, however, that it will be found that the chief obstacle to our gaining <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> by any of the half-a-dozen attempts we have made against it, by both the overland and the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> lines, has been the rebel army that has obstructed our path, rather than anything in the path itself.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> It is every day becoming more apparent that the <rs>Yankee</rs> despotism, despairing of conquering us by means of pitched battles, in which they have rarely ever failed to be worsted, have changed their plans, and now hope to wear us out by starvation and the force of their superior numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>They have, with a want of faith which it is scandalous even to think of, taken every opportunity to violate the cartel solemnly established by duly authorized commissioners, under the hope of forcing us to abrogate it; and, finding that object unattainable, they have abrogated it themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>They will exchange no more prisoners, hoping that the vast number left on our hands will assist them more effectually where they are, by consuming our provisions, than they could hope them to do in the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>They can afford to spare them, they think, because their places will be supplied from <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, while the <rs>Confederate</rs> prisoners whom they detain cannot be replaced from our smaller population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>This is an ingenious calculation &mdash; such a calculation as a people naturally cowardly and more disposed to effect their objects by trickery than by strength would be likely to resort to. The remedy is to feed <hi rend="italics">their</hi> prisoners on the smallest possible allowance consistent with the bare preservation of life &mdash; to take as few hereafter as possible, and to instil into our troops the duty of never surrendering as long as there remains the least possible hope of opening a passage by the sword or the bayonet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> The indecisive character of the battles which we have heretofore fought greatly assists the enemy in carrying out his schemes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>We have been almost always victorious, yet we have never in a single instance derived any benefit from our victories, and in all of them we have lost a vast number of men. We have not the least doubt that in his <num value="3">three</num> battles, in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00210" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> lost as many men as the victorious party lost in the <num value="3">three</num> battles of <placeName reg="Marengo, Iowa, Iowa" key="tgn,2035190">Marengo</placeName>, <placeName reg="Austerlitz, Lucas, Ohio" key="tgn,2140495">Austerlitz</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Jena, Loudon, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099764">Jena</placeName>, each of which struck down an Empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Yet <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00211" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, although victorious in all his battles, not only gained nothing, but lost ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It is difficult to understand of what use such victories can be to us, when the results have been such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>A defeat could hardly have produced a catastrophe more unfavorable to us. The enemy is vastly more numerous than we. He knows that in every battle we fight we lose large numbers of men, although we may be victorious, and that we find it difficult to replace them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>He knows, too, that although he may lose <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, he can more easily replace those <num value="2">two</num> than we can replace that <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Thus he hopes finally to wear us out by the mere force of numbers, as the <name>Russians</name> did the <name>Poles</name> in the revolution of <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The Poles defeated them in every battle; but in every battle the <name>Poles</name> lost men, which their scanty numbers did not enable them to replace, and thus in the end they were exhausted by their own success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> way to prevent the recurrence of such a misfortune here, and that is to push our victories when we gain them and to gather some fruit from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>In general, we have been contented with merely gaining the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We never think of pushing it to its legitimate conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>We vote it imprudent to follow up an enemy who is flying for life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>It is very prudent, however, to let him get to a place of safety, where he can recruit at his leisure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Then he comes out, and it is very prudent to fight another desperate battle, in which we lose <num value="4">four</num> times as many men as we should have lost had we followed him while he was disorganized by defeat.
