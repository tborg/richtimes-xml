<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The election in New York, for members of the <name>Legislature</name> and other State officers, was to take place yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Both parties have centered their efforts chiefly upon the election of members of the <name>Legislature</name> &mdash; the <name>Democrate</name>, anxious to get a body willing to <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> their Governor, and the <name>Republicans</name> hoping to embarrass him by an opposition Senate and <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The most noticeable fact (according to the <rs>Democratic</rs> papers) connected with the meeting was that, of the list of <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice Presidents</rs> read, <num value="2">two</num> from each town in the county were prominent gentlemen who voted for <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for <rs type="role2">President</rs>, and for <persName n="Wadsworth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Wadsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Wadsworth</surname></persName> last year for Governor, but who in the approaching election intend to vote the <rs>Democratic</rs> ticket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> <num value="1">One</num> year ago we were a people united in purpose &mdash; to-day we are distracted and paralyzed. --Why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>To-day the <rs>South</rs> which was then ready to fall to pieces, is united, and apparently as strong as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Why? That party most endangers the public welfare which not only refuses to use every influence that can be brought to hear, but opposes obstacles in the way of a successful completion of the contrast in which we are engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>That man who, not content with restoring the <rs>Union</rs> and up holding the <rs>Constitution</rs>, adds further objects more difficult of attainment, hinders the success of the war. I appeal to you, men of <placeName key="tgn,7020632" n="1.000 7" reg="onondaga, onondaga, new york">Onondaga</placeName>, men of Central New York, if they are not making success more difficult, more unattainable, if in any event they are not postponing the end, until you are brought nearer and nearer those calamities which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He straight in our pathway &mdash; national bankruptcy and national ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They say we must fight until slavery is extinguished; they say we must fight until the <name>States</name> shall assume new relationships to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> &mdash; until it becomes revolutionary in its aspects and influences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We are to unsettle what <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> of experience had settled; we are to upturn the foundations of our Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>At this very moment, when the fate of the nation and of individuals trembles in the balance, <hi rend="italics">these</hi> madmen ask us to plunge into a bottomless pit of controversy upon indefinite purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Does not every man know that we must have a united <name>North</name> to triumph?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Can we get a united <name>North</name> upon a theory that proposes to centralize the power of the <rs>General Government</rs> upon propositions that you shall not have the great right and liberty of protecting your own person?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>that the <rs>Constitution</rs> can be set aside at the will of <num value="1">one</num> man, because, forsooth, he judges it to be a military necessity? ["No, no."] I never heard yet that <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was a military necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>[Great laughter.] If military necessities are to govern, let us at least be consistent, and ask that military men shall judge what these necessities are &mdash; men who can marshal armies in the field and fight great battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The very proposition disfranchises you. If you assent to it, you men of Central New York, give up your constitutional right to your own judgment. </p> </q><!--<bibl n="Gov. Seymour's"></bibl>--></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Now I propose to inquire, What has taken place since I stood here <num value="1">one</num> year ago?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>What were the circumstances of our country then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>At that moment the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had given, voluntarily, under the calls of our Government, <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men to swell the ranks of your armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Before that time our political opponents, through their journals and speakers, had said that the <name>Administration</name> had failed in the conduct of the war. Therefore it was that at the last <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> election, when you did me the honor to place me in the <name>Gubernatorial</name> chair, you decided that they had failed in meeting the just expectations of the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>You gave them <num value="600000">600,000</num> more, <num value="600000">600,000</num> living men &mdash; somebody's sons, somebody's brothers, somebody's husbands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They went from the homes of our land; they constituted the wealth and power of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Where are they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>What has been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Is our country saved?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Is the war terminated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>To- day, when we ought to rejoice at the full completion of our heart's desire, we are met &mdash; not by assurances that peace is restored to our land, not by the fact that rebellion is put down; no, my friends, we are met by another call for <num value="600000">600,000</num> men. This moment everywhere our armies are on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The question to day is &mdash; not "What are we doing? "but "What are the enemy doing?"The question is --not "Where do our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> attack?" but "Where are we threatened?" Look at the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Look at the <rs>Cumberland</rs> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Notwithstanding the vast contributions of blood, and men, and treasure, to day we are called upon to furnish <num value="600000">600,000</num> more, including the number embraced under the <name>Conscription</name> act, and you, the people of New York, to-day are called upon to furnish <num value="108000">108,000</num> men before the <date value="01-05">5th of January</date> next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Now, there are some things about which there is no difference of <hi rend="italics">opinion among</hi> candid men of all parties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> It is agreed that there is a limit in the expenditure of money when the nation must be whelmed in national bankruptcy, and that there is a limit in the prosecution of the war when the nation will go to ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Every day's expenditure of life and money brings us nearer to these calamities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We agree that the war must be brought to the speediest possible honorable conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Now, which of the <num value="2">two</num> parties asking your support is the <num value="1">one</num> most likely to reach this result before we reach national bankruptcy, ruin, and disgrace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Let the past go. We will leave it to the judgment of the future to say who has been right and who has been wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Let us now confront the duties of the hour boldly and patriotically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>We are to decide by our votes what shall be the future policy of the <rs>Government</rs>, for I tell you the voice of New York will be potential in the end. If the people of this State shall decide in favor of the radical policy, which is to prolong the war for indefinite issues, we are lost forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>On the contrary, if the people of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>State decide in favor of a policy which can be reached and which will bring the war to a successful conclusion, there is yet a glorious future for our land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Where do the <num value="2">two</num> parties differ?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The Republicans say, "We want to put forth all the material powers of our land to bring the war to a close."We say so, too. We are upon the brink of a cataract, without time to inquires into the past; we must put forth every material power to secure success to our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>But we say more than that; we say that we will add to the power of force the influences of wise statesmanship, of conciliation, of <name>Christian</name> charity, of patriotic purpose.--[Cheers.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> The draft has been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great attempt to exercise this power, and it has miserably failed. --instead of strengthening the <rs>Government</rs>, it has immeasurably weakened it. I do not fear for the <name>States</name>, but for the <rs>Federal Governments</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The great <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName> can maintain her rights when the little men who insult her are passed away and forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>[Great cheering.] You remember how gloriously the <rs>State</rs> responded to the calls for volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Our rulers, when they saw the mighty armies they had marshaled, thought it had been done by their own power, instead of by the spontaneous patriotism of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>They said we will pass around the hat no more when we want men ormoney, but we will pass a law and send out force, so that when we want men we will take them out of the houses of the nation by compulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>New York sent out of itself <num value="120000">one hundred and twenty thousand</num> volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Now look at the result of the draft for <num value="68000">sixty-eight thousand</num> men. They gave you credit under that draft for <num value="21000">twenty-one thousand</num> men. How is this <num value="21000">twenty-one thousand</num> made up?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Well, you are valued as being worth about <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">three hundred dollars</measure> apiece, and of these <num value="21000">twenty-one thousand</num> men which have been rendered, <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="13000">thirteen thousand</num> are <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">three hundred dollar</measure> bills &mdash; not men of muscles and sinews ready to do service; and that act has not sent out from this State <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> men. I do not believe it has more than <num value="6000">six thousand</num>, and more than half of these are substitutes, which is another name for volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>So much for the centralization policy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> You are to decide the most momentous questions ever submitted to a people; questions that come home to each man of you in all the relationships of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The mighty debt that is being rolled up is an encumbrance upon your property, and now equals <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the value of the whole property of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>So far as it is necessary to spend for proper purposes, let it be poured forth; but if it is to gratify the theories of fanatics and bigoted men, we should express our disapproval of those theories that are mortgaging our lands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>We are willing to sustain them in all constitutional purposes; we dedicate ourselves and all we have to the preservation of our country; but when they ask of us sacrifices for the purpose of trampling down the <rs>Constitution</rs> and destroying the great principles of liberty, then we must at least have the poor privilege of raising our voices in terms of expostulation against a policy so fatal and ruinous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>We love that flag (pointing to the stars and stripes) with the whole love of our life; and every star that glitters on its blue field is sacred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>And let me conclude with the sentiment of a citizen of another State, declaring that we will preserve the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>We will preserve the <rs>Union</rs>; we will preserve our flag, with every star that glitters upon it, and we will see to it that there is a State for every star.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>[Continued cheering.] </p>

<head>Near Prospect of a Couple of battles.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> While we are kept in constant expectation of a <rs n="Battle of Chattanooga" type="battle">battle at Chattanooga</rs> by the proximity of the <num value="2">two</num> armies in that quarter, the <rs>Yankee</rs> newspapers give unmistakable signals of an approaching fight also on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It has been rumored, indeed, and we suspect with some truth, that <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> has received positive orders from <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,,"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> to attack <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs> see that the season for campaigning is passing rapidly away, and that unless <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> be "crushed" between this and the <dateStruct value="-12-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> they will not be able to eat their <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas dinner</occasion></dateStruct> in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, as they have so often threatened to do. They appear, also, to be just at this time terribly excited by the reports of certain returned prisoners, that we are starving those that are left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>They point to the emaciated condition of these same returned prisoners as a proof of the truth of their tale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Our readers doubtless recollect that at the last exchange of prisoners the <rs>Yankees</rs> sent a batch of sick and wounded, and that a similar batch was sent on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>These are the men the <rs>Yankees</rs> refer to as affording, in their own persons, a proof of the cruel manner in which we treat our prisoners, ascribing their evil plight not to their diseases and wounds, but to our severities, and endeavoring to make us answerable for their own inhumanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>For it was <hi rend="italics">they</hi> who set the example of removing for exchange Confederate prisoners who were too ill to endure removal, thereby compelling us to do the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>However, they seize upon this pretext to stimulate the drooping ardor of their soldiers, and their papers call aloud for an instantaneous march to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and the rescue of their brethren, who are starving to death in spite of the <num value="70">seventy</num> bullocks a day which we are told are slaughtered to give them sustenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>They are reasonable men, to be sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>They violate all the obligations of common honesty by abrogating the cartel, solemnly entered into, under the hope that the multitude of prisoners thrown upon our hands may reduce us to starvation, and now they complain that those prisoners are partakers of the very famine they are left here to produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It is all a lie, however.--The prisoners are treated much better than the <rs>Yankee Government</rs> has any right to expect, considering their object in leaving them here, and fully as well as prisoners of war are ever treated anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It is to get them back, however, to rescue them from death by famine, that the <rs>Yankee</rs> army is now appealed to <sic>to</sic> advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>And the advance, we believe, will be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>We shall then see whether it is so easy to take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> as the <rs>Yankee</rs> newspapers would have us believe, or whether the <orgName>army of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName></orgName> is to be counted for nothing in the prosecution of such an enterprise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> It is not exactly plain whether the advance is to be made by <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> or the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, or direct from the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Either way will suit us if it suits <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>We can assure all these gentry, by way of inducement, that <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is not so absolutely destitute of the means of making a good <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas dinner</occasion></dateStruct> as they seem to imagine.--We can still afford a good minced pie, although we dare not venture to promise a plum pudding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>We have not the best material for a bowl of egg-nog; our white sugar is running low, and our rum growing scarce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>In the course of a year or <num value="2">two</num> the lady who has excited so much interest dies, leaving an only child, the heroine who gives her name to the novel, and who from that time becomes the idol of her father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The heiress of boundless wealth, indulged in every whim and caprice, suffered to learn or not to learn as <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> she may think proper, never having been taught to check a single passion or to obey any authority but the impulse of her own wishes, with a good natural disposition, and no accomplishment save that of a dashing horsewoman, the young lady grows up as wilful, spoilt, and ungovernable a country hoyden as it is common to see. At the age of <num value="16">sixteen</num> she falls desperately in love with her own groom, whom she had been taught by a cunning female confidant to consider a nobleman cheated of his birthright, and reduced to his present low condition by some person or persons, we forget whom, nor is it necessary to remember.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Her father, too late, interposes an authority which he had never before exerted, and which he now finds quite ineffectual to restrain her headlong passion and headstrong will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>He sends her to <placeName reg="Paris, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2113557">Paris</placeName> to finish her education &mdash; she rewards his affection by eloping with the forbidden groom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>She marries him, and soon finds out that he is a low creature, who has but <num value="1">one</num> object in view &mdash; to plunder her, namely, of all the money she can raise.--At length he quits her, or she quits him, and she returns home, where her history during her absence is unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It is reported to her that her husband is dead, and she sets up for a young lady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Of course she is soon surrounded by suitors, to <num value="1">one</num> of whom, a young officer of great talents and accomplishments, who had served in the <name>Crimea</name> with distinction, she becomes attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>She agrees to marry him, provided he will trust her so far as to require of her no account of the manner in which she spent <num value="1">one</num> whole year of her life &mdash; that part of it, namely, including her residence in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>This he declines to do &mdash; the match is broken off, and she accepts his rival &mdash; a great, stupid, clown of a country <persName n="Squire,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00213" reg="mostcommon:Squire,nomatch:0"><surname>Squire</surname></persName>, half booby and all horses jockey, without culture and without refinement, but good-natured, and trustful to such a degree as to take her, missing year and all. They are married, and thereupon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> husband makes his appearance, and is received as a sort of stable superintendent by the husband incumbent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>His object, of course, is to extort money by threats of a discovery, and he succeeds in doing so, until he is murdered on returning from an interview with her by <num value="0.5">a half</num>-witted hostler who had been dismissed from the establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Suspicion fails on her; but finally all things are cleared up &mdash; the true murderer is hung &mdash; and the other parties dismissed to the happiness usual in novels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> Such is an outline of this story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>It is of what is called the <hi rend="italics">intense</hi> order; an order that we do not particularly affect, but which is very pleasing to young gentlemen and young ladies who have no sorrows that they can properly call their own, and in default of such borrow from the fictitious world to supply themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>We cannot say that we think very highly of the moral; but, fortunately, in this country young ladies do not fall in love with their grooms, and therefore there may be no harm done. </p> </div3> </div2>
