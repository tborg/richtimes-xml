<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>An immense concourse of people assembled in front of the <rs type="place">Spotswood House</rs>, and vociferously called for his appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>He finally presented himself, and addressed the multitude in glowing and eloquent allusions to the brilliant occurrences of <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> He described the brilliant movement of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName></hi> from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and with fervid feeling drew a graphic picture of the struggle of the wearied soldiers of that gallant command for <measure n="7hours" type="date">seven hours</measure> with the heavy columns of the enemy. --After paying a most honorable tribute to <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>,</hi> who seized the colors of a regiment and rallied them to the flag of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, he alluded to the glorious manner in which <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName></hi> came to the support of his comrade in arms, and at a late hour relieved him of the odds against which he was contending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Each of these <num value="2">two</num> able and consummate commanders, though not imprudently or idly exposing their persons where it was unnecessary, yet, when their presence was demanded, gallantly dashed before the lines, and by their personal courage and example reanimated the ranks whenever they were shaken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, in a delicate manner, alluded to his own appearance upon the field, in order to pay a tribute to the devotion of the soldiers to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Men, he said, who lay upon their backs, wounded, bleeding and exhausted, when they saw him pass, though they could do nothing else, waved their hats as they lay, and cheered for <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName></hi> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Where the ranks had been broken and the men were somewhat scattered, when they saw the <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>South</rs> in their midst, shouted that they would follow him to the death, and rallied once more for the last and the successful onslaught. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> alluded also to the immensity and extravagance of the outfit which the enemy had provided for their invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Provisions for many days; knapsacks provided with every comfort; arms the most perfect; trains of wagons in numbers which the mind could scarcely comprehend, and ambulances for the officers stored with luxuries that would astonish our frugal people whom these minions of the <rs>North</rs> had taxed for <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure>, attended their marching columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But the columns themselves were scattered and chased, like hares, from the battle ground, throwing away and leaving behind everything they could get rid of, and leaving us all the equipments we have described as the trophies of victory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> concluded with a glowing tribute to the gallantry of the soldiers of our army, invoking the praise and blessing of the country upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He reminded the people, however, that the enemy was still in strong force, and that much hard fighting was yet before us, urging the country to unremitted diligence in pushing on the war. </p> </div3>

<head>The fallen brave.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Of all the forms in which man can meet death, none is more grand and beautiful than that in which he lays down his life in a good cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Death is the common lot of all, and in <num value="1">one</num> shape or other must overtake every man; but he who goes forth to meet it for the benefit of humanity, may well be said to die more gloriously than did <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Socrates,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Socrates,nomatch:0"><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>,</hi> for "<hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Socrates,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Socrates,nomatch:0"><surname>Socrates</surname></persName></hi> died like a philosopher," but this man "like a <name n="God" type="God">God</name>." Nobler life can no man live than he who walks in the footsteps of the incarnate Son of Deity, nor a more godlike death than to perish, in humble imitation of Him, for the good of the human race. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Thus the <name>Martyrs</name> and Confessors of all ages, who have passed through great tribulations and at last sealed their holy faith with their blood, are most honored in the <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian church</orgName> of all the earthly representatives of its crucified and risen <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, the <rs>Divine Martyr</rs> of Calvary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>And surely, next to them, in disinterestedness, self-sacrifice and heroism, we may place the glorious men who die for their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But it is wrong to say that such men die. Bullets and bayonets may slay the body; the soul they cannot hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Pure as the overhanging firmament from which their spirits look down upon us, bright as the stars which illumine its immeasurable depths, immortal as the <name>Being</name> whose presence pervades illimitable space, the spirits of the just can never die. Every generous heart feels a pang of agony as well as pride to see many a mother's darling, the laughing dimples of youth yet upon his beardless cheek, rush gaily by to the scene of strife and blood, and hot tears rush to eyes unused to weep at the thought of that fair head pillowed on the bloody turf; and yet, where could mortal die as well?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Pity the desolate ones at home; but for him, the death that must have come at last and tom him reluctant from the earth, he has gone bravely forth to meet, and in the virtue and valor of self- sacrifice, has robbed it of its sting and despoiled the grave of its victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>When <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wolfe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Wolfe,nomatch:0"><surname>Wolfe</surname></persName>,</hi> on being told that the <rs>French</rs> retreated, exclaimed, "I die happy," he expressed, no doubt, the feelings of every true hero as he looks his last upon the earth and feels that he has not died in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Happy in being a benefactor, at the cost of his own life, to his native land and to humanity; happy in knowing that he will be remembered with love and gratitude, and that he himself will be permitted to look down and see how from his blood will spring the life-giving plants of freedom, independence, and happiness to his country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> The deepest affliction of death, in this as in every other form, is not that of those who die, but the relatives who survive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Human sympathy is inadequate to the consolation of those who suffer from distress like this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The hackneyed common-places of funeral occasions stir the soul as little as the sable pumas and crapes which custom has prescribed for the funeral procession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>For the man who dies in peaceful life there is, outside his own family and relatives, no real grief, and little sympathy even with the wretched survivors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>But for him who dies in his country's cause, a country mourns; every heart honors his memory, every eye weeps with those who weep for him, and every breast is anxious to share the burthen of their woes. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Our recent victories should only reinvigorate our exertions and redouble our preparations for an active prosecution of the war. Peace is our object, and we can obtain peace only by conquering it with force and arms.--The dogged pertinacity of the <rs>Northern</rs> character will make them persist in this war as long as they can keep us on the defensive, and as long as danger does not actually threaten their own homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>So long as the battlefields are upon Southern soil, though we whip them in every engagement, yet we shall be little nearer peace than when the war began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We can obtain a cessation of war only by conquering it, and the conquest must be effected upon their own soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> To this end we must enlarge our army immensely and make an effort commensurate with the importance of the object to be attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>To bring an army into the field powerful enough to accomplish our purposes, some reference should be had to the character of the enemy's forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It must be borne in mind that he will be deficient in horses, and therefore deficient in <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> and cavalry.--Our facilities for organizing a large force of these <num value="2">two</num> arms are very great, and it so happens that this is the very description of force best suited to purposes of invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Hence we should have a great preponderance in <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> and cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The success of invasion consists in celerity and suddenness of movement, and great strength in these <num value="2">two</num> classes of troops is essential to our operations in the enemy's country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> On the other hand, the enemy are armed with small arms of a very superior description. --When engaged, therefore, we should always threaten his flanks with our superior cavalry, shake his ranks with our superior artillery, and, advancing under this influence with our infantry, deliver our fire and charge with the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The <hi rend="italics">forte</hi> of our infantry should be the <hi rend="italics">charge</hi>--for the <rs>Northern</rs> nerve cannot resist a Southern bayonet charge pressed home with swiftness and momentum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Should we succeed in the charge of infantry, our cavalry and <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> would cut up the flying enemy; should we fail and have to retreat, our cavalry, acting in concert with our artillery, would fire into and charge upon parties detached in the ardor of pursuit, would protect our rear, check the advance of the enemy, and soon enable our men to rally and renew the fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> It is very plain, therefore, that great encouragement should be given to the organization of cavalry companies, and that all of those which have been formed should be ordered into the field; those armed with sword and pistol to be sent forward immediately to the armies engaged before the enemy; those not armed with these weapons to furnish themselves as soon as possible with guns and ammunition to suit; and even with the lance, which is the queen of cavalry arms, and ought never to have fallen into disuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>We believe that a company or <num value="2">two</num> of effective mounted lancers would do more execution upon a flying enemy than <num value="3">three</num> times their force of imperfectly trained cavalry armed with the dragoon sabre and the cavalry pistol. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> When mounted companies are unable to obtain the requisite arms for cavalry duty, they should be formed into <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> batteries, and at once be put in a course of training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The South could soon have <num value="50">fifty</num> effective batteries in the field if she chose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>She has the greatest quantity of artillery pieces and an abundant supply of cannon powder.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> There will doubtless be ordered out an immense increase of our fighting force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Very large numbers of infantry regiments are thronging every railroad leading up from the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>While the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States are thus furnishing such ample numbers of infantry, the extraordinary facilities afforded by <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> for cavalry and <orgName n="Flying Artillery" type="artillery">flying artillery</orgName>, ought not to be neglected.--The subject is worthy of the serious and prompt attention of our Government. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>It was a cold, winter night, and the coachman, as he drove his horses over <placeName key="tgn,2540359" n="1.000 8" reg="newmarket, newport news, virginia">Newmarket</placeName> heath, poured forth such a volley of oaths and foul language as to shock all the passengers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>The old clergyman, who was sitting close to him, said nothing, but fixed his piercing blue eye upon him with a look of extreme wonder and astonishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>At last the coachman became uneasy, and turning round said to him, "What makes you look at me, sir, in that way?" The clergyman said, still with his eyes fixed upon him, "I cannot imagine what you will do in Heaven!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/> Some years afterwards the clergyman was detained at an inn on the same road, and was told that a dying man wished to see him.--He was taken up into a bedroom in a loft, hung round with saddles, bridles, bits and whips, and on the bed, amongst them, lay the sick man. "Sir," said the man, "do you remember speaking to the coachman who swore so much as he drove over <placeName key="tgn,2540359" n="1.000 8" reg="newmarket, newport news, virginia">Newmarket</placeName> heath?" "Yes," replied the clergyman. "I am that coachman," said he, "and I could not die happy without telling you how I have remembered your words: 'I cannot think what you will do in Heaver.' Often and often as I have been driven over the heath I have heard these words ringing in my ears, and I have flogged the horses to make them get over that ground faster, but always the get over that ground faster, but always the words have come back to me: 'I cannot think what you will do in Heaven'" </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/> We can all suppose what the good minister said to the dying man.

<head type="nobreak" rend="smallcaps">The importance of Allowing fowls to feed themselves.</head> 
<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/> --When fowls have access to grain all the time, we see them eat in the morning only a few kernels at a time, and after an hour or so, they will take a few kernels more, and thus they pass the entire day by eating a little at a time, and very often. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> The philosophy of their eating so frequently and but a little at a time is, the food has a sufficient time to become softened in the crop before it passes into the gizzard, and it has sufficient time to be thoroughly ground and digested; whereas, when fowls are not allowed to have access to their food, but are fed once or twice a day, they become very hungry, and swallow as much as their crops will hold at <num value="1">one</num> feeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>Now for several hours, no food will be softened sufficiently to pass into the gizzard, consequently their grist mill must stand idle. --Now the moistened grain swells and distends the crop of the fowl, and it feels by no means comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Shortly all the food in the crop is in the proper condition to be ground, and the result is, that it is forced through the gizzard with so much rapidly that it is not half ground, and therefore cannot be half digested; and if it is nutriment or egg-producing material, can be extracted from it. Nor is the greatest drawback attending feeding fowls only once or twice a day. When a fowl fills his crop at <num value="1">one</num> feeding, before the food can possibly get out of it, it begins to heat up, and derangement and ill-digestion follow, very much as is the case when we fill our stomachs as full as they can be crammed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/> The way to feed fowls, and particularly those that are laying, or being fattened, is to allow them to have free access to food at all times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>In this way they can always supply the demands of their stomachs and grinding apparatus, exactly as food is needed; and they will fatten more rapidly, or lay more eggs, and consume much less food than they will if they are fed, as they will eat twice a day. </p> 
<p>
