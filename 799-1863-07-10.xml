<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We have lost <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>That no longer admits of a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We have lost <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is rapidly advancing upon <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, with forces which are represented as irresistibly superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The latter General will now be compelled to retreat, we presume and as he has heretofore been much celebrated for the masterly character of his retrograde movements, we are induced to hope that he will not, on this occasion, fall below his reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The <rs n="Fall of Vicksburg" type="battle">fall of Vicksburg</rs> is a heavy blow but it is by no means of such a character as ought to render us despondent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In the <unclear>eat</unclear> States of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, now that the people are thoroughly awake to their situation, may be found resources sufficient to cover all that we have lost by the <rs n="Fall of Vicksburg" type="battle">fall of Vicksburg</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs> do not open the navigation of the river by their success, and that is the great object, they say for which they have been fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Above all, we look to the invincible spirit of the <rs>Southwest</rs>--that spirit which has borne them up through the disasters of <num value="3">three</num> campaigns &mdash; for the materials of resistance and of ultimate triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>A people determined never to be conquered cannot be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We shall doubt only when we <unclear/> the people begin to falter. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> In the year <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Lander,,Richard,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Lander,Richard,,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Lander</surname></persName>, the celebrated <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> traveller, who had <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> before solved the mystery of ages by successfully exploring the course of the <rs>Niger</rs>, and <unclear>ing </unclear> triumphantly into the <rs>Atlantic</rs> by <num value="1">one</num> of the months, undertook a commercial voyage to the <unclear/> river, under the auspices of a Liverpool firm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Anticipating hostility from some of the savage tribes that inhabit the banks of that river, he had provided himself with an iron steamboat, and in this he prosecuted the enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He soon found his anticipations of savage hostility realized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The driven attacked his boat from the shore with bows and arrows and such old condemned tower muskets as they had been able to collect in their <unclear/> with the <rs>English</rs>, killed a great part of his crow, <unclear/> wounded himself, and <unclear>ly</unclear> broke up the expedition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The moral of this tale is, that trade cannot be carried on upon a long narrow river, inhabited on both shores by a hostile population, even though that population be savage, and even though the boats be <unclear/> of iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Much more, then, in it impossible to carry it on through a highly civilized population, animated with the most deadly hatred, abounding in skillful marksmen, possessing cannon and small arms in abundance, and determined that the <unclear>ing</unclear> shall not be done <unclear/> such is precisely the condition and feeling of the country from <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> to the <name>Belize</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The people are brave and enterprising; they possess arms and ammunition in abundance; they hate the <rs>Yankees</rs> as the <name>Devil</name> is supposed the hate holy water, and they are determined not to allow the river to be navigated by their trading boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>What good, then, will the capture of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, and of every other strong place on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, do the <rs>Yankees</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They are fighting they say, for the free navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Does this advance the cause for which they are fighting?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Are they any nearer their object now then they were when they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> drew the sword?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Do they mean to carry on trade in iron clad ships of war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Are there to be no more flat boats, no more high pressure steamboats, no more rafts, no more of any of the cheap and time honored vehicles in which the commerce of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> has been transported ever since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlement of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> colony on its banks?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Trade to be successful and continued, must be secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>That is <num value="1">one</num> of the very <unclear>orements</unclear> of its existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It is this necessity that has caused so many insurance companies to spring up throughout Christendom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>in is this that has driven <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of the <rs>Yankee</rs> commercial fleet from the water, and fined the whole length the <rs>Yankee</rs> ports and dock yards with useless hulks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It is this that has transferred the sceptre of the commercial world once more to the hands of <persName n="Semmes,,England,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Semmes,England,,,"><foreName>England</foreName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName> and Malfit, almost alone, have been enabled to effect this wonderful change, merely by the fear they inspire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>But what are <persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Semmes,England,,,"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName> and Malfit, with a couple of vessels navigating the wide <rs>Atlantic</rs>, to a population of several <num value="1000000">millions</num> inhabiting both sides of a narrow river and always ready to pounce upon every freight boat as it passes along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>What <name>Yankee</name> company will insure a cargo to run the gauntlet from <persName n="Allen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Allen,nomatch:0"><surname>Allen</surname></persName> to New Orleans, through the dense forests that line some parts of the course, and the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of wood yards that are strewed all along the banks, where whole regiments of sharpshooters or light artillerists may be waiting to sink the vessel, or seize it as a prized if any be found bold enough to undertake, what will be the <hi rend="italics">premium!.</hi> Cheapness of transportation is another element of commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>How can it exist where transportation is to be made in iron clads, and at a premium of <num value="1">100 per cent</num> it will be better to submit to the skinning process of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> cormorants, and transport by rail to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> But suppose all the danger past, and the born-flour, bacon, and tobacco, safely landed on the levee at New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Who is to buy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It is a part of the subjugation scheme to rip up the goose that lays the golden eggs &mdash; to cut down the tree that supplies the precious fruit &mdash; to liberate the negroes that make the cotton and sugar &mdash; to ruin the planter that purchases the produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Who, then, is to buy it, or what is to become of it, unless it be re-shipped at enormous coat to New York or the <rs>West</rs> ladies? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> We tell our countrymen that they have no reason for despair, or even for despondency at the loss of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The pertinacious gallantry with which it has been defended has made our people place too high an estimate up &mdash; on its importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Its capture does not and cannot command the course of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>That is now and always will be in our power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>No trade can be carried on upon it but with our consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>So well convinced were many of our best officers of this fact that they from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> expressed their opposition to risking any portion of the army, in any fortress upon the river, for the purpose of interrupting the trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>This they thought could best "don" <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> by means of strong parties with artillery, scattered about along its course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>In gaining <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> the <rs>Yankees</rs> have not advanced <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure> towards their object. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>Telegraphic lies.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> The unfounded and extravagant stories that have been transmitted recently by the telegraph, occasion wide spread complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The press and the public have been annoyed past endurance by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>From the <rs>Southwest</rs> we have had message after message that was, if not incredible upon its face, contradicted by subsequent information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/><persName n="Milliken,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Milliken,nomatch:0"><surname>Milliken</surname></persName>'s Bead has been taken several times, yet we have never had possession of it. <persName n="Smith,,Kirby,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, <persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Taylor,,Dick,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="default:Taylor,Dick,,,"><foreName>Dick</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> have been made to cross over the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and do a great many things which they never have done &mdash; and have been rapidly moved from <num value="1">one</num> point to another at a great distance in an incredibly short space of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/><persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName> <num value="1">one</num> day is marching upon New Orleans, when it is not probable he is outside of the boundaries of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Everything is received with doubt that comes from that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The last report that <persName n="Taylor,,Dick,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="default:Taylor,Dick,,,"><foreName>Dick</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> had crossed the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and was joining <persName n="Gardner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Gardner,nomatch:0"><surname>Gardner</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, had completely routed <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>, and marched on to reinforce <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> of course must be received with the incredulity that the questionable <unclear>ter</unclear> of everything by telegraph from that quarter is so well calculated to inspire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> But all at once the telegraphers from the <rs>North</rs> appear to be ambitions of outstripping their contemporaries of the far <rs>South</rs>, and with <num value="1">one</num> bound go a long way ahead of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>We are informed from <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName> that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, by an adroit move, has captured <hi rend="italics"><num value="40000">forty thousand</num> of the enemy,</hi> and they "refuse to be paroled! " The number of prisoners are finally reduced to <hi rend="italics"><num value="4000">four thousand</num>,</hi> and some have been charitable enough to imagine that there was a mistake in transcribing the sum, by which <hi rend="italics"><num value="4">four</num></hi> was magnified into <hi rend="italics"><num value="40">forty</num>.</hi> But the signs of the telegraph do not admit of such a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Yet again, if this were not so, the particularity with which the message described the movement of the falling back of the centre, and the enveloping the enemy by the closing in of the <num value="2">two</num> wings of our army, leaves no loop hole for explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It is true the telegrapher may, and no doubt did, hear a flying rumor to the effect of what he wrote; but is that the sort of information to be gravely transmitted to the press and <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War. Department</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Reverses are had enough without having added to them the sickening depression of being let down from the elation of a reported brilliant victory to a veritable retreat of our army, after a series of the most sanguinary combats of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> Some measures ought to be adopted to protect the public and the <rs>Government</rs> from these unreliable and false messages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The matters to which they relate are too important to be submitted to such untrustworthy sources of intelligence. </p> </div3>
