<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>On Monday there was a large gathering of the people, when a beautiful flag was thrown to the breeze, drawn up by the tender and delicate hands of some of our young ladies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>A subscription paper was handed around, and about <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">$10,000</measure> raised, for arming and equipping the volunteers, and for other purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The most perfect order and unanimity prevailed, and I never witnessed such a degree of enthusiasm </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>On Wednesday they were engaged most of the time in drilling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Just at night they were marched to the <orgName n="Presbyterian Church" type="church">Presbyterian Church</orgName>, and after singing and reading appropriate parts of Scripture and prayer, were affectionately commended to the care and keeping of the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Battles--<persName n="Edwards,Reverend-Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,M.,,,"><roleName n="Reverend-Mister">Rev.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/> While the brave <rs>Marylanders</rs>, to defend themselves against the <name>Innards</name> of Northern troops, have had to resort to the manufacture and use of pikes, because of the deficiency of muskets &mdash; and while arms are needed by the militia, and even volunteer companies, in many exposed counties of <placeName reg="Virginia county">Virginia</placeName>, it is said that there are <num value="50000">50,000</num> muskets in the arsenals of the <rs>State</rs>, in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName>, which had been conditionally sold by our Government for <measure n="1.50dollars" type="currency">$1.50</measure> each, but the sale not made final, nor the arms delivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>Why not supply these arms to <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>It is true, that these are flint-lock muskets, of old construction, and therefore of very inferior value to the most improved modern arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>But they were deemed, throughout the war of <date value="1812">1812,</date> good arms of that time, and certainly would be a great acquisition wherever all fire arms are very scarce, and where the arming of troops is greatly needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>The writer of this piece bore and used <num value="1">one</num> of these muskets, as a private volunteer, through <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> service near <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> in the early part of the war of <date value="1812"> 1812.</date> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>During all his service then, and also later, he never heard of <num value="1">one</num> of these State muskets bursting, or that they were deemed inefficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>All then in the arsenals had been subjected to very severe testing some time previous to the war. The many muskets made in this armory, which never were issued, and therefore never abused, must be capable of their best possible service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>There may be good reasons &mdash; not, however, to the writer, or to the public &mdash; for the wholesale rejection of, and refusal to use, those arms, and their designed sale for almost nothing, when arms are so greatly needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>But even with no more evidence than his own experience and recollections of their use and value, though of time <measure n="49years" type="date">forty-nine years</measure> past, he cannot believe that these muskets are not good enough to be put to good use at the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Would that they were in the hands of the brave <rs>Marylanders</rs>, who, almost without arms, are now fighting our battle on their own soil, and at their own expense of blood and treasure! </p>
