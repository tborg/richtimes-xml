<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> If epithets had been effective missiles of war, as destructive as the projectiles of rifled cannon, the <rs>Yankees</rs> would long ago have had the <rs>South</rs> conquered and subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The <hi rend="italics">Tribune, Herald and Times</hi> would have done the work more thoroughly and quickly than all the <rs>Sherman</rs>'s, <persName n="Griffin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Griffin,nomatch:0"><surname>Griffin</surname></persName>'s and <orgName type="mil" key="RIBattery">Rhode Island batteries</orgName> that could have been brought into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The war in that case would have been short, sharp and severe, in fact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The favorite epithet with the <rs>Yankees</rs> is <q>"rebels,"</q> a term implying a right on their part to govern, and the duty on ours of obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They have convinced themselves that we are an inferior sort of people; that it is they who support, feed and protect us; that we are under the ban of mankind and the frown of Heaven, for the sin of slavery, and that it is by virtue of their own extraordinary righteousness and favor in the right of the <name>Almighty</name>, and of the countenance and protection which they choose to vouchsafe unto us, that Heaven mitigates its frowns, Earth mollifies its anger, and we are permitted to exist. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> That we, therefore, poor, helpless and weak, should presume to <q>"secede"</q> from their patronizing alliance; that we should attempt to shuffle off what they consider the <q>"mortal coil,"</q> refusing life and committing flat suicide by the separation, strikes them with amazement and indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They considered they were doing a most righteous thing by preserving us in their holy keeping; and, by running away, we deprive them of the luxury of an ostentations and most profitable charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They abused and reviled us, it is true, without stint, protested that the protection cost them dearly, and threatened to turn us out beggars upon the world &mdash; all to magnify the benevolence they were bestowing upon us; and they would have executed their threats long ago, if, in fact, we had not been a very profitable set of heathen dependents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> What is their astonishment, therefore, when the poor, starved, <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-forsaken heathen, with-draw, of their own accord, from their protection; and what their indignation at the thought of losing the objects of the most profitable charity that ever Puritans or hypocrites bestowed upon fallen humanity ! Such folly, such madness, such ingratitude, they sum up in the indignant word, <hi rend="italics">rebellion.</hi> That a bigoted, pharisaical, self-conceited feeling of this sort is at the bottom of their supercilious conduct towards us, must be admitted; or else they must be conceded to have forgotten all the facts and circumstances of the revolutionary struggle, in which this very word, <q>"rebellion,"</q> was the shibboleth, and in which they claim to have borne a conspicuous and honorable part on the <q>"rebel"</q> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Unless we are helpless, imbecile, pauper, heathen, revolting, from a guardianship of godliness and benevolence deserving of infinite gratitude; their epithet, <q>"rebels,"</q> applied to us, is really as honorable as it was in the case of the fathers of the country in the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Then, no less a man than the great <rs>Fox</rs>, annoyed at the flippant use of the term by the minions of government in parliament, rebuked them by declaring: <cit><q rend="inline">"The term rebel is no certain mark of disgrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>All the great assertors of liberty, the saviors of their country, the benefactors of mankind in all ages, have been called rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>We owe the <rs>Constitution</rs> which enables us to sit in this house to a rebellion." </q><!--<bibl n="no less a man"></bibl>--></cit> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> A recent <name>Irish</name> paper has denounced the flippancy of the <rs>Yankees</rs> in the use of this same term with just and eloquent indignation, as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> "A Republican people, whose liberties were won by a rebellion, whose independence was achieved by secession, parrot as glibly as any minions of Old World tyranny 'the rebels' and the 'rebellion,' as phrases of odium and reproach ! Those who profess to hold sacred the popular will, to reverence the desire for self-government, proceeding to drown the popular will in blood, and to answer for self-government by butchery and slaughter ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> "If what is now passing in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> took place in any of the <rs>Old World Empires</rs>, it would be at least intelligible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If the citizens of nearly half of an Empire <num value="5">five</num> times as large as all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, with an unanimity never surpassed, and rarely equalled, declared, by free poll, in open day, by universal suffrage, that their interests and their feelings demanded the substitution of the <rs>Imperial Government</rs> by <num value="1">one</num> of their own choice; and the <rs>Imperial Government</rs> marched its armies to crush the demand in the blood of the 'rebels,' it would be nothing new among the despotic systems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But in a great Confederation of Republican States, in a system based on the <hi rend="italics">will of the people</hi>--based on the <hi rend="italics">right of rebellion</hi>--that all this should happen that we now see &mdash; that no tyranny or despotism of old <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> ever drew the sword more savagely to put down rebellion and trample upon the voice of the people, than this same Central Government of a Republican Confederation-- It is enough to wring the heart of any man who believed in the greater humanity and toleration of popular Governments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> "Well may the advocates of despotic monarchy laugh in bitter mockery at those who believe that a people ruling themselves would never spill blood in popular subjugation, and that such murders were done by kings and despots of old <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> "It is a hideous sarcasm of Republicanism to hear the journals of the <rs>Northern States</rs> yelling for the blood of the 'rebels,' for their utter subjugation and destruction !" </p> </q><!--<bibl n="Irish paper"></bibl>--></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> With all the cunning and aptitude of the <rs>Yankees</rs> in private matters touching their individual interests, they are the most giddy, frivolous, ignorant and silly people in public affairs that the world ever beheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>They have not stumbled upon a single act of wise statesmanship since this war commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The career of the <orgName n="Yankee Union" type="union">Yankee Union</orgName> without the statesmanship of the <rs>South</rs>, is, and will be come more and more, like the vicious, wicked acentric and supremely silly career of the children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> when without the guidance of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName></hi> and the prophets.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> I have been for sometime visiting the sick and wounded soldiers of the memorable <rs>Manassas</rs>, and find that they are doing well in some places, at others not so well; there is a strong tendency in may cases to typhoidal fever, or in other words the fever which succeeds the wounds, as a necessary recuperative effort of nature, which assumes the character of a low, typhoid fever, destroying many lives that would, under the usual circumstances, recover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Another very singular circumstance observed, is that <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the wounded of both armies are wounded from the hips down to the feet; a great number in the knees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Those that have been early operated on by timely amputations, have done best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>I don't think, as a general rule, that a sufficient number of amputations have been performed, and many will die of constitutional irritation whom an early amputation would have saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>In some of the houses, the nurses inform me that they find it exceedingly difficult to keep maggots out of the wounds; in fact, I saw them on the bandages, and in the wounds, in a number of instances, where both nurses and surgeons had discharged their duty with commendable benevolence, patriotism and rigid care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/><persName n="Fairfax,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>, a highly estimable gentleman, and an excellent surgeon, who has charge of the wounded at the <rs type="place">University</rs> under <persName n="Cabell,Professor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Cabell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <surname>Cabell</surname></persName>, and surely there is a large number there &mdash; informed me that he found the flies very troublesome, depositing maggots despite of all precautions &mdash; and that he found the application of calomel the best remedy for their expulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I think, however, that these are serious objections to the remedy, as its local application to the skin, even, will produce constitutional effects, and <hi rend="italics">(a fortiori,)</hi> much sooner when applied to a wound or denuded surface, as in this latter case it comes in immediate contact with the absorbant vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I suggested a lotion or wash to <persName n="Fairfax,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>, which I will here repeat, that every wounded soldier may have the benefit of it; and I want them all to know it, both in private houses and the hospitals: The best remedy against maggots, both after they have been deposited in the wound and before, is to bathe the wound, or wet the bandages, in a strong decoction of common elder, (or <foreign lang="lat">sambucus canadensis.</foreign>) The fly will shun this thing; and if the maggots are burrowed in the wound, and a little of the decoction is injected or poured in, they will come out. The decoction is made by boiling any quantity of the leaves and tender stems of the elder in water, which is to be used, as before observed, as a wash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I will also state here that I have never observed any irritating effects from the elder, and, if anything, the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The planters in many portions of the <rs>South</rs> have long been familiar with the properties of the sambucus or elder in expelling maggots from the wounds of stock; but I claim to be the author of the fact, as well as of the medical properties of the cotton plant, as may be seen by reference to the <rs>U. S. Dispensatory</rs>, the organ of American Pharmacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I state these facts for no other purpose than to ameliorate the sufferings of my countrymen, who have poured out their blood in defence of constitutional liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>And if any <num value="1">one</num> will mingle amongst our wounded friends and brothers, as I have done, and see how much they are annoyed by flies this hot weather, they would hall the discovery of a remedy against them as a boon from heaven, therefore I publish it that as may know it. </p> </div4> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> Her ministrations were not those of <hi rend="italics">form,</hi> but were those of <hi rend="italics">deed</hi>--deeds not intermittent or transient; but continuous and enduring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>She sat not selfishly or prudishly aloof from her patients until their manly forbearance, overcome by their swelling anguish, called timidly for relief; but she stayed, whether waking or dozing, by their sides, anticipating their every want. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> Had this been only to the undiseased wounded, she would have merited praise; and had she in this died only from exhaustion, she would have deserved a golden monument of memory in the heart of her country; but when, as was the case, these ministrations were to the sick &mdash; the infectiously diseased, from whom she died, she deserves &mdash; what shall I have it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> Let those now recovered soldiers upon the tented field, and those convalescents now amid the endearments of home, whose renewed lives are parts of her life given them; let their parents, relatives and friends; let her grateful country and an appreciating world, say what shall be her reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>For, unlike the manly soldier, she ventured not within the gates of death under the sustaining influence of martial music, of enthusiastic multitudes, and the surety of glory's reward &mdash; nor yet, for a pecuniary consideration; but she visited the charnel precincts from a religiously patriotic sense of duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> Beside those solemn portals I made her cheerful acquaintance, and, as simulation cannot be upon the stage she trod so nobly, I feel that I knew her well, and can well say that no purer, sweeter soul dew drop was ever from the <name>Hermon</name> of virtue absorbed into Heaven by the sun-ray of duty performed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the most splendid, and at the same time truly awful conflagrations, it has ever been my lot to witness, filling the night with its lurid glare and the silence with the crackling of its flames, has just laid the beautiful village of <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName> in ashes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> My quarters are not far remote from the scene of the fire, being on the opposite bank of the stream, a short distance further down; and when I awoke at <time value="12am">midnight</time> amid the firing of guns, and under the glare of the burning village, the scene presented was <num value="1">one</num> to belong remembered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Yesterday evening, a deserter from the rebels managed to wade to the dismantled end of the bridge, and pulling himself up by <num value="1">one</num> of the piers, escaped to our picket on this side, and was taken to the fortress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The information which was at last obtained from him, was to the effect that <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> of the enemy had marched, with rations for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, since yesterday morning, from <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>; that they were now formed in line of battle a short distance back from <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> Quite an excitement was thus created in camp and at the fortress, and preparations were made for any emergency which might occur during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/><persName n="Weber,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Weber,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Weber</surname></persName>'s entire regiment were put on active duty, and, as I rode through the camp last evening, were being supplied with extra ammunition for the splendid rifle, with which they are armed, <num value="2">two</num> extra companies were put on picket duty, and the remainder were kept in camp as a ready reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Early in the evening &mdash; about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>--a few rebel bullets came across the river and were answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>After that all remained quiet until about <time value="11:30">half past 11</time>, when the enemy opened fire upon our pickets near the bridge, discharging their muskets by sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Our men instantly fell upon their faces, or they would have been mowed down by the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The fence near <placeName><persName n="Mallory,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Mallory,W.,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>'s house</placeName> is riddled with their bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Very fortunately, not <num value="1">one</num> of them injured a single man of ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>When the enemy ceased firing, our men rose and gave a deliberate rifle fire among them, as it is supposed, doing them much damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>An alarm, of course, by this proceeding awakened the camp, when a few moments afterwards a building in the southern end of the village was observed to be on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Not more than <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> transpired before the whole village was lighted up as if every house had been a lantern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>At <time value="12am">midnight</time> the flames were raging wildly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>I was awakened to the realization of the fact by the firing of the rebels upon the guards near my quarters in the <rs type="place">Seminary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>This firing was returned and soon entirely ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>I then hastened up the river on horseback to get a full view of <num value="1">one</num> of the grandest sights that can be imagined. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> Our sentries were on the <hi rend="italics">qui vive.</hi> <q>"Give the countersign quick, or I fire !"</q> said <num value="1">one</num>, as I approached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/><q>"New York,"</q> said I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/><q>"Correct,"</q> said he. And on I sped to ward the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Others, with almost fatal vigilance, guarded the read at every few rods distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>An enemy, or even a friend, without the talismanic word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>would have fared hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>As it was, I believe some of our own men were fired upon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> At <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> I stood near <placeName><persName n="Mallory,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Mallory,W.,A.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>, and by the riddled fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The flames were exulting in their power, and rushing on to their work of destruction with terrific grandeur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The woods and houses on this side of the river were covered with a kind of weird light, reflected from the conflagration, and the country for miles around was illuminated.--The clouds seemed to dance with the light of bursting flames, that leaped toward them in it full sheets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The wind from the south blew to furiously upon the town, and spread the flames from house to house and street to street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The river seemed all on fire with reflected light, and now and then some of the buildings, standing on its very brink, tilted their burning sides into the water with a splashing, hissing, steaming sound, that added much to the effect of the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Near by me stood <num value="2">two</num> companies of <persName n="Weber,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Weber,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Weber</surname></persName>'s men, upon whose faces the light shone widely &mdash; Others lay prostrate upon the grass along the roadside, ready, at a moment's warning, to spring into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The only sound that we heard were the crackle and roar of the flames, mingled now and then with the crash and plunge of some falling building, with all its treasury of sparkling, flashing embers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> I wrote a brief dispatch by the light of the flames whose heat was becoming uncomfortable, and then turned back to the camps, after a long, absorbing gaze on the terrific scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>I found the roads and camps alive with soldiers, all waiting and anxious to-be called into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Company after company had been sent out towards Foxhill and the adjacent country, to act as pickets, patrols and skirmishers, and their return was anxiously awaited at the reserve stations, where the guard listened intently for the discharge of guns, which should warn them of an approach of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>At their headquarters I found <persName n="Weber,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Weber,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Weber</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" n="acting-Brigadier-General">acting Brigadier General</rs>, and <persName n="Von,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Von,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Von</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Dagun, of his staff, who had been out before to explore the dangers of the night, and were now awaiting reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>With them was <persName n="Wales,,Captain,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="default:Wales,Captain,,,"><foreName>Captain</foreName> <surname>Wales</surname></persName>, or the <orgName type="mil" key="MountedRiflemen">Mounted Riflemen</orgName>, and after a social chat I again returned to the scene of the conflagration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The flames still raged wildly, and had extended, embracing the back of the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>A party of our men had been across into the village and returned, bearing information that the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>, the only building of any consequence which I had thought on my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> visit would survive the flames, had just been fired in the basement by the rebels, who came in the rear of the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The floors had been covered with camphene and <rs n="burning fluid" type="">burning fluid</rs>, and holes hacked through them to afford draft for the fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> A few moments after it was lighted up from within with a light that told well of its approaching destruction by the fire demon, that ravaged the once beautiful village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Every window became lividly red, and I watched it until the sides of the fine building began to quiver and reel in the tempest of flame and wind, and the pillars in front toppled and tumbled <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> from their foundations to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Then a side fell in, and the flames leaped triumphantly over it as it buried itself in the cellar beneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Thus house after house, and building after building, melted like wax before the fiery element, and threw a lurid glare up to the sky. A long heavy line of clouds floated away towards the <name>Fortress</name>, as if crying for help for the poor village, as I guided my, horse back to my quarters, and turning to look once more, sought rest from the excitement and fatigues of the night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> This forenoon I visited the spot again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Nothing but a forest of blear-sided chimneys and walls of brick houses tottering and cooling in the wind, scorched and seared trees and heaps of smouldering ruins, mark the site of 'loveliest <placeName reg="Auburn, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2110491">Auburn</placeName>; columns of smoke rise here and there, from yet the seething masses, and desolation has marked its blighted path until a clear vista of the forests far beyond the town is afforded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The bridge was saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>It had been, as I have mentioned, dismantled about a rod from its father end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> To a little barricade at the farther extremity, which, when the rebels commenced firing, sheltered <num value="2">two</num> of our pickets, I saw <persName n="Stomph,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00080" reg="mostcommon:Stomph,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Stomph</surname></persName>, of the <rs>German Regiment</rs>, and <num value="6">six</num> of his men, march bravely in the face of the flame and the foe when both were hottest &mdash; Many eyes watched the little company anxiously, as they marched on wish firm, unwavering step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Every moment we expected to see them fall before the enemy's shot, for the flashing light of the conflagration made them more prominent than daylight could have done, and the waters of the river mirrored them, and every motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>They reached the barricade, however, in safety, and stood with their rifles ready to pick off any incendiary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> A more desolate sight cannot be imagined than is <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00081" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Last evening it was <num value="1">one</num> of the most beautiful villages on the continent, with wealth of cottage and villas embowered in luxurious foliage, and adorned with taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The streets were straight and shadowed by interlacing boughs, and all that can add beauty and refinement to a country place of <num value="2500">2,500</num> or <num value="3000">3,000</num> inhabitants has been the dower of <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00082" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/> <hi rend="italics">General.</hi> The important question of the proper disposition to be made of fugitives from service in States in insurrection against the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, to which you have again directed my attention in your letter of <date value="07-30">July 30th,</date> has received my most attentive consideration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/> It is the desire of the <rs>President</rs> that all existing rights in all the <name>States</name> be fully respected and maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>The war now prosecuted on the part of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> is a war for the <rs>Union</rs> and for the preservation of all the constitutional rights of States and of the citizens of the <name>States</name> in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Hence no question can arise as to fugitives from service, within the <name>States</name> and Territories in which the authority of the <rs>Union</rs> is fully acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>The ordinary forms of judicial proceeding, which must be respected by military authorities alike, will suffice for the enforcement of legal claims But in States wholly or partially under insurrectionary control, where the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are so far opposed and resisted that they cannot be effectually enforced, it is obvious that rights dependent on the execution of those laws must temporarily fail, and it is equally obvious that rights dependent on the laws of the <name>States</name> within which military operations are conducted, must be necessarily subordinate to the military exigencies created by the insurrection, if not wholly forfeited by the treasonable conduct of parties claiming them To this general rule, rights to services can form no exception. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/> The act of Congress approved <date value="1861-08-06">August 6th, 1861.</date> declares that if persons held to service shall be employed in hostility to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the right to their services shall be for felted, and such persons shall be discharged therefrom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>It follows of necessity that no claim can be recognized by the military authorities of the <rs>Union</rs> to the services of such persons when fugitives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>A more difficult question is presented in respect to persons escaping from the service of loyal masters </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/> It is quite apparent that the laws of the <rs>State</rs>, under which only the services of such fugitives can be claimed, must needs be wholly, or almost wholly, suspended as to remedies by the insurrection and the military measures necessitated by it; and it is equally apparent that the substitution of the military for judicial measures, for the enforcement of such claims, must be attended by great inconveniences, embarrassments and injuries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/> Under these circumstances it seems quite clear that the substantial rights of loyal masters will be best protected by receiving such fugitives, as well as fugitives from disloyal masters, into the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and employing them under such organizations and such occupations as circumstances may suggest or require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Of course a record should be kept, showing the name and description of the fugitives, the name and the character as loyal or disloyal of the master, and such facts as may be necessary to a correct understanding of the circumstances of each case after tranquility shall have been restored. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/> Upon the return of <orgName n="Peace Congress" type="congress">peace, Congress</orgName> will doubtless properly provide for all the persons thus received into the service of the <rs>Union</rs>, and for just compensation to loyal masters &mdash; In this way, only, it would seem, can the duty and safety of the <rs>Government</rs> and the just rights of all be fully reconciled and harmonized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>You will, therefore, consider yourself instructed to govern your future action in respect to fugitives from service by the principles herein stated, and will report from time <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> is time and at least twice in each month, your action in the premises to this Department. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/> You will, however, neither authorize nor permit any interference by the troops under your command with the servants of peaceful citizens in house or field, nor will you in any way encourage such servants to leave the lawful service of their masters; nor will you, except in cases where the public safety may seem to require it, prevent the voluntary return of any fugitive to the service from which he may have escaped. </p> <closer> <salute>I am, General, very respectfully, Your obedient servant.</salute> <signed>(Signed,) <persName n="Cameron,,Simon,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00277" reg="default:Cameron,Simon,,,"><foreName>Simon</foreName> <surname>Cameron</surname></persName>, Sec'y of War.</signed> </closer> </div5> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Those who composed the mob answered with ejaculations like the following: <q>"Fire, you traitor"</q>--<q>"you rebel and secessionist"</q>--<q>"fire, if you dare."</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>They agreed to this; but, before anything could be done, the soldiers were at the head of the stairs, and all parleying was at an end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/> The great number of peace meetings now being held all over the country are most significant; and the studied efforts of the ultra war journalists to suppress all information concerning them, evinces a wholesome dread of their influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>The people are waking up. The reign of terror no longer awes them into silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>It is becoming very evident that the voice of the farmers, mechanics and merchants of the rural districts is not for a vindictive or <hi rend="italics">abolition war.</hi> They have no profits to make from contracts with Government, and seek no share in the unclean drippings of public plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>These peace meetings are of course quite alarming to those who are accumulating magnificent fortunes as jobbers, contractors, antlers and camp followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>Peace will put an end to the selling of old vessels shoddy clothing, wooden soled shoes, tainted pork, beef, &amp;c., to the <rs>Government</rs>, at <num value="3">three</num>, <num value="4">four</num>, or <num value="5">five</num> times their value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>Then there will be no longer an inviting field for agents and middle-men, who divide the spoils with the contractors and jobbers, or shave the soldiers of a percentage on their rations and wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>If we have peace, these worn out party hacks and soldiers of fortune, who continue to put themselves prominently forward on every committee which has the handling of large sums of money, will lose their golden opportunities for amassing fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>Such may well threaten to hang those who favor peace.
