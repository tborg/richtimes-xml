<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> --Some days since, while writing in my office, my attention was directed to a small spider descending from the under side of a table in the corner of the room, where it had stationed itself unmolested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>A large horse-fly, many times too large for the spider &mdash; which was very small &mdash; to manage, had by some means become disabled and lay on the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The spider descended to the fly, and, with some caution, began to entangle it in its web, and soon had it completely bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>The spider then ascended to the table, and soon descended again, and thus continued to ascend and descend for some time, fastening the fly more completely each time it returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>I was at a loss to know its object in binding the fly so completely on the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Soon, however, it ceased descending, and appeared to be busily employed at its station near the table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Other figures could be represented by changing the flag to the left hand, and varying the motions accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>When held perpendicularly over the head, it might mean that the market generally was up; and when held down at a sharp angle to the body, it might indicate the reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Half revolutions to the right would give half numbers; the same to the left, quarters; and over the head, <num value=".125">eighths</num>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>We have read it with much interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Its design is to set on foot a project which will eventuate in the formal transfer of the allegiance of the most influential <name>Indian</name> tribes from the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> to that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.--The Appeal says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> The message very properly assumes a permanent dissolution of the old <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> as an accomplished fact, and acknowledges the futility of all hopes looking to a future reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> being disintegrated into <num value="2">two</num> Governments, with conflicting claims and in a state of declared hostilities, it is asserted that the treaties made between them and the <name>Chickasaws</name> are annulled, and the latter virtually a sovereign and independent nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> In consideration of this fact, the <rs>Governor</rs> urges "that delegates on the part of the <name>Chickasaws</name>, be appointed to meet delegates from the <name>Choctaws</name>, Cherokees, Creeks, Seminoles, and other neighboring tribes, to assemble in Convention for the purpose of confederating together for mutual safety, and the defence of their country against invasion, to secure the independence of the <rs>Indian</rs> nations, severally or collectively, as may be deemed best." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It will be the duty of these functionaries to take such steps as may be necessary to secure all the funds belonging to the <name>Chickasaws</name>, now unlawfully detained by the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> We are not surprised at this foreshadowed manifestation of a spirit of resistance among the <rs>Indian</rs> tribes, but on the other hand have been a long time anticipating its outbreak. --Were they not infected with a notorious sympathy for the <rs>Southern</rs> people in the issue of war now joined between the <num value="2">two</num> sections, the treatment which they have recently received at the hands of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> would be amply sufficient to goad them into a state of revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The troops have been withdrawn from their frontier, leaving them exposed to attack from the guerilla bands that infest their territory, and they have been refused arms for the purpose of self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>In addition to the perpetration of these wrongs, the <rs>Black Republican</rs> authorities, calling themselves the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, have failed to pay them the annuities guaranteed by the laws of the land, doubtless using the same in the prosecution on the war.

<head>Cure for Stammering.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/> Some years ago a famous professor came to a town where I was then residing, and announced that he could <q>"cure the worst cases of stuttering in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>, without a surgical operation."</q> A friend of mine was an inveterate case, and I advised him to call upon the wonderful magician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>He called, was convinced by the testimontals exhibited, struck up a bargain, paid the <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure>, and soon called at my office, talking as straight as a railroad track. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/> I was greatly astonished, and asked my friend by what miracle he had been so strangely and suddenly relieved of his lifelong trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>He most provokingly informed me that he had made a solemn pledge not to reveal the process of cure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/> I knew <num value="2">two</num> other bad cases &mdash; ladies &mdash; and, calling upon them, reported what had come to pass. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/> They were soon at the <rs>Professor</rs>'s room, came away greatly elated, raised the <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">hundred dollars</measure>, went the next day, paid the cash, and in half an hour were ready, had the question been popped, to say yes ! without a single jerk. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/> I was soon made acquainted with several other cures quite as remarkable, and resolved to put on my sharpest wits and wait upon the magician myself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/> He seemed an honest, earnest man, and in <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> I had made up my mind to pay a large fee and learn the strange art, with the privilege of using it to cure whomsoever I would. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/> Those who had been cured by the <rs>Professor</rs> were solemnly bound not to reveal the secret to any <num value="1">one</num>; but my contract gave me the privilege of using the knowledge as I pleased. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/> And now I propose to give the readers of my journal a simple art which has enabled me to make very happy many unhappy stammerers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>In my own hands it has often failed to effect the desired result, but in <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the cases which I have treated the cure has been complete. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/> The secret is simply this: The stammerer is made to mark the time in his speech, just as it is ordinarily done in singing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>He is at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to beat on every syllable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>It is best at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson to read some simple composition like <num value="1">one</num> of <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName>'s Psalms, striking the finger on the knee at every word; then read in a newspaper, beating each syllable Soon you need only beat on every word. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/> You can beat time by strking the finger on the knee, by simply hitting the thumb against the forefinger, or moving the large toe in the boot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/> I doubt if the worse case of stuttering could continue long, provided the sufferer would read an hour or <num value="2">two</num> every day, with thorough practice of this simple art, observing the same in his conversation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/> As <num value="1000">thousands</num> have paid <num value="50">fifty</num> and a <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">hundred dollars</measure> for this secret, I take great pleasure in imparting it to the generous patrons of my journal. </p>
