<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> It is well known that a great many letters were found at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, written to or by the soldiers, and a mail bag for a Connecticut regiment was found at <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName>. --The <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi> says that all these letters have been examined, and in the whole lot there were not more than half a dozen which were not too vulgar and obscene for publication. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> This statement is confirmed by an English gentleman who was permitted to examine the letters, and who informs us that it is impossible for those who have not read them to form any adequate conception of their beastliness and depravity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Well did <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Joseph,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName></hi> pronounce great cities great sores upon the body politic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The bloated wealth which the <rs>North</rs> has wrong from Southern commerce has entailed curses, compared with which the lowest ills of poverty are blessings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>An aristocracy made up chiefly of illiterate and vicious men, who have acquired wealth suddenly by unscrupulous arts of money-getting, and a working class whose lives are passed in crowded factories or in other occupations in cities which are favorable to anything but moral advancement, there has been developed, especially in the <rs>Puritan</rs> stock, an amount of unmitigated devilism which it is perfectly frightful to contemplate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> If the letters referred to by the <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi> could be printed &mdash; if decency, if civilization permitted such a thing &mdash; the world would be struck dumb with amazement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Language could not be found to express the sensation which such a lifting up of the top from the pit of darkness would cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We challenge the <rs>Northern</rs> press to produce a single letter or diary found upon a dead soldier of the <rs>South</rs> which he or his friends would blush to see in print.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Here is a diary found upon the body of a Southern soldier, and published in a Black <orgName n="Republican Journal" type="newspaper">Republican journal</orgName>, the <orgName n="Cincinnati Commercial" type="newspaper">Cincinnati <hi rend="italics">Commercial</hi></orgName>, with its own comments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>That this is a specimen of the high, and often religious, tone of our noble defenders, we do not expect Black Republicans to credit, because vile natures cannot believe in virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>All was military; all wore the aspect of warlike vigilance and preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Even the whistle of the locomotive sounded more like the war snort of a ferocious beast than a peaceful signal for the sleepy-looking negro brakeman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>And the little <num value="2">two</num>-story hotel, which formed a sort of frontispiece to the scene, was evidently on its military behavior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Our tents were left at <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, and the supply of food was scant and insufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> We bivouacked that day and night, obtaining some food, which, with some rest, much refreshed and strengthened the men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> On <date>Sunday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct>, immediately after breakfast, we received the order to <q>"fall in"</q> with knapsacks and arms, and take up the line of march towards where the fire of the enemy <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>After marching in that direction some <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> most of the distance in double-quick time, our direction was suddenly changed towards the left of our line of battle, to which we marched a distance of some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, in quick and double-quick time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The day was exceedingly hot, and the supply of water being small, the men arrived on the battle-field much exhausted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> I suppose it was about <time value="9am">9 o'clock A.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> The enemy were right in front of us in overpowering numbers &mdash; She man's battery fully commanding our position, supported by immense bodies of infantry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> Hardly had we halted and formed before the order came to advance, which we did in double quick, through the open field, to within a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of the enemy's line, where we were commanded to <q>"halt and lie down."</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> The left of our regiment was in the cornfield, and the right in the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The fire at once became general &mdash; our men rising to fire and lying down to load. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> Our advance was covered by <num value="1">one</num> piece of artillery, the fire of which did much to divert the attention of the enemy from our advance movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Even in that hour of peril we could not fail to admire the accuracy and effect of its aim. Unfortunately, after <num value="3">three</num> rounds, the horses attached to the caisson became frightened and ran off, leaving the piece without ammunition, and leaving us unprotected by artillery, except in so far that the gallant <rs>Imboden</rs> was permitted, by the heavy fire in his front, to yield us occasional shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Although they could come but seldom, when they did come we recognized in them the booming <q>"<name n="God" type="God">God</name> cheer" </q> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7002659" n="1.000 5060" reg="alabama">Alabama</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> For an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num> the <orgName type="regiment" key="4ALRegiment">4th Alabama Regiment</orgName> sustained the most galling and destructive fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Our brave men fell in great numbers, but they died as the brave love to die &mdash; with faces to the foe, fighting in the holy cause of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Of course, it is impossible for me to say how many were opposed to us. I only judge from the incessant and tremendous fire that was kept up, that we were greatly outnumbered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> The forces intended for our support on the right and left having been withdrawn for <num value="3">three</num> quarters of an hour, alone and unaided, except by <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Imboden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Imboden,nomatch:0"><surname>Imboden</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, we held our position, driving back, on <num value="3">three</num> several occasions, the advancing columns of the enemy, and enabling reinforcements to come up. At last, outflanked on the right and left, and exposed to fire from <num value="3">three</num> sides, we were ordered to fall back. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> We retired in good order through the woods on our left, and, descending a hill, again formed in line of battle on a branch which runs through the ravine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>On our right, as we descended the hill, we observed <num value="2">two</num> regiments drawn up in close column in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>These being <num value="1">one</num>- quarter of a mile behind the position which we had just left, and where we expected to find reinforcements, were confidently regarded by us as friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>They returned our signal, and we were on the point of forming behind them, when, as we unfurled our flag, they opened a murderous fire upon our ranks, killing some and wounding many; among the latter, Lieut.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> Left thus without field officers, and almost surrounded by the enemy, we again fell back, after returning in kind and with effect the compliments of our supposed friends, through a pine wood to an open field where we halted and awaited orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The thirst of the men was intense and almost intolerable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> At this place, <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half mile</measure> behind our original position, amid the bursting of shells and the ratting storm of musketry, our heroic <persName n="Bee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Bee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bee</surname></persName> rode up to the regiment and inquired what body of troops we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Being told that <q>"it was what remained of the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL4">4th Alabama</orgName>," </q> he replied, with an expressive gesture, <q>"this is all of my brigade that I can find &mdash; will you follow me back to where the firing is going on?"</q> <q>"To the death,"</q> was the response, whereupon he put himself on the left of our line and marched us by the left flank to where the fight was raging around <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>As we were nearing the scene, a train of artillery that was falling back cut our line, thus separating the left company from the rest of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>This company, with our General at its head, oblique to the right, upon the open plain, and proceeded about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">100 yards</measure>, when our gallant and beloved commander fell mortally wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>The rest of the regiment, not seeing the direction which the head of the column had taken, marched straight forward through the wood, exposed at every step to a galling fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Deprived, as we then were, of our <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</rs>, of our <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> We remained on the field until the battle closed, with ranks thinned, it is true, but yet always with a perfect organization. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> The regiment was exposed to heavy fire for <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure>, and during the whole time, and particularly during that portion of it when they were actually engaged, the officers and men exhibited the most admirable coolness and gallantry. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Now, the whole tenor of the <rs>Federal</rs> telegrams concerning the battle &mdash; guarded, as they are, in language, and known to be given to the repression of facts &mdash; indicates that <persName n="Lyon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00298" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,nomatch:0"><surname>Lyon</surname></persName>'s forces were badly beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The loss of <num value="800">eight hundred</num> men is acknowledged; the death of <persName n="Lyon,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00299" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lyon</surname></persName> himself is officially announced, and also the retreat of <persName n="Siegel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00300" reg="mostcommon:Siegel,nomatch:0"><surname>Siegel</surname></persName>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> upon <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName> and subsequently towards Rolia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>It is not even known that he has accomplished this movement, and the telegraph's report only presumes that he is safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>As it has not generally seen the section of skillful commanders to follow up a victory by immediately placing a distance of more than <measure n="100miles" type="distance">one hundred miles</measure> between them and the foe they have beaten, option <unclear/> would teach us to believe that this <q>"splendid Union victory"</q> is nothing less than a disastrous defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Such is our relating of the official dispatch of <persName n="Fremont,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00301" reg="nearbymention:Fremont,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName>, and so it was intended to be understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>We learn from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> that dispatches have been received at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, stating that <persName n="Siegel,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00303" reg="mostcommon:Siegel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Siegel</surname></persName> lost a considerable portion of his camp equipage, artillery and wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>This, however, is carefully concealed from the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>Of course we place no reliance upon the reported killing of <persName n="McCulloch,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00304" reg="nearbymention:McCulloch,Benjamin,,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>McCulloch</surname></persName> and <persName n="Price,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00305" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"/><surname>Price</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The official dispatch cautiously alludes to it as a report merely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>If, therefore, the report should turn out to be true, it does not follow that either <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00309" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><surname>Price</surname></persName> or <persName n="McCulloch,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00310" reg="nearbymention:McCulloch,Benjamin,,,"><surname>McCulloch</surname></persName> is killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>They may, both perhaps, have been wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>Missing they are not likely to be when the <rs>Federal</rs> forces venture to offer battle again.

<head>More Frauds in high places.<lb/>[from the <rs>Paris</rs> correspondent of the <rs>London</rs> lander, <date value="07-23">July 23d.</date>]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/> The financial scandals which have been the privatise topic here during the past week have ripened into bloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>The <q>"director of a great public establishment,"</q> who has been compelled abruptly to resign his post, <persName n="St. Georges,,Mode,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00404" reg="expanded:St. Georges, Georges.Mode,,,"><foreName>Mode</foreName> <surname>St. Georges</surname></persName>, has been able, owing, it is said, to august interference, to compound with his creditors, by handing over to them a handsome sum down, and making arrangements for the ultimate liquidation of his debts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>The <q> "pawnbroker general"</q> whose misdeeds I have alluded to, is <persName n="Dieu,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00405" reg="default:Dieu,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Dieu</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>He has absconded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Among the charges against him <num value="1">one</num> at least is romantic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>A lady of high rank, the <rs>Duchess</rs> de &mdash; being in want of a large sum of money, pawns her family jewels, including diamonds of great value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>As a matter of course they were soon afterwards redeemed, but instead of the diamonds and emeralds she had deposited with the untrustworthy by <persName n="Dieu,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00406" reg="default:Dieu,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Dieu</surname></persName>, she receive back only skillful imitations in paste and rock crystal!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>The fight of <persName n="Dieu,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00407" reg="default:Dieu,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Dieu</surname></persName> leaves Government responsible for a sum of about half a <num value="1000000">million</num> sterling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/><num value="1">One</num> of the bankers whose embarrassments have been also referred to is <persName n="Ogier,,M.,Pegot,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00408" reg="default:Ogier,M.,Pegot,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>Pegot</foreName> <surname>Ogier</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>His name appears boldly to the official list of bankrupts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>His rating are said to be heavy, and nothing precise is known as to the nature of his assets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>The Correctional Police is likely are long to be engaged with an investigation of his affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>Another case &mdash; that of M. <persName n="St. Paul,,Calley,de,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00409" reg="expanded:St. Paul, Paul.Calley,de,,"><foreName>Calley</foreName> <foreName>de</foreName> <surname>St. Paul</surname></persName>-- has also been the subject of many dark innuendoes; but as the gentleman has the good luck to be aid de-camp to <persName n="Fleury,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00410" reg="mostcommon:Fleury,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Fleury</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Aide de camp">aide-de-camp</rs> to the <rs>Emperor</rs>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> equerry, &amp;c., it is probably that his difficulties will be smoothed over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>A full investigation of his affairs might be compromising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/><persName n="Baron,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00411" reg="default:Baron,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Baron</surname></persName>, banker of <unclear>Ba</unclear> Nointor near <placeName key="tgn,7008927" n="1.000 4" reg="le havre,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Havre</placeName>, has been declared a bankrupt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>His liabilities are said to be heavy, and report asserts that <num value="3">three</num> <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00412" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> bankers, who have made their names familiar to the public by copious advertising, are in flight &mdash; The names of these gentlemen are no secret, but I withhold them until something more definite has been ascertained. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>Scandals at the <rs>English</rs> bar &mdash; case of <persName n="James,Mister,Edwin,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00413" reg="default:James,Edwin,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Edwin</foreName> <surname>James</surname></persName>.<lb/>[from the <rs>London Globe</rs>.]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/> The announcement made to day that <num value="1">one</num> of the most prominent members of the <rs>English</rs> bar has been expected from his profession, will occasion more regret than surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>It has been no secret that for several weeks past the <name>Benebern</name> of <num value="2">two</num> of the <rs>Inns</rs> of Court have been engaged in investigating charges of malpractice made against a member of each of the institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/><num value="1">One</num> of these cases is still undecided, and upon it we shall, therefore, make no remark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>The other terminated last night, when <persName n="James,Mister,Edwin,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00414" reg="default:James,Edwin,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Edwin</foreName> <surname>James</surname></persName> ceased to be a member of the bar of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>The grounds of the decision have not been made public, and are hardly a fair subject for newspaper comment, but we cannot doubt that it was just and deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>It is not for the sake of adding any atom of severity to so miserable a fall that we allude to the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>It is because we fear we must consider the decision of the <name>Benchers</name> not only a righteous conclusion from the facts of the case, but a lesson which is not wholly unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>It is not a satisfactory thing to have to say, but it is no more than the truth, that there are members of the proportion of which <persName n="James,Mister,Edwin,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00415" reg="default:James,Edwin,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Edwin</foreName> <surname>James</surname></persName> has just joined to be a member, upon whom an example in the way of severe punishment is likely to have more effect in the regulation of their professional conduct than those higher dictators, those instincts of honorable minds, which brought more than any rule or any fear of consequences to give security against transgression of fairness, truth and honesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>That there are persons engaged in this honorable called who are uninfluenced by such considerations is unfortunately a matter of profession, if act of public, notoriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>We believe that they constitute but a small proportion of the bar, but they are yet sufficient in number to render their offences more a matter of reproach than if it were merely the case of some <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>We deemed it our duty severed months ago to make some observations on the subject which we are aware had but too good a foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>Perhaps the bar itself has been to blame for not visiting these delinquents with the moral punishment it is in the power of any body of gentlemen to inflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>We trust, however that the present lesson will not be lost upon them, and that if from no higher motive than the fear of being <num value="1">one</num> day in the same position as this most unfortunate individual, they may become more respectable members of their profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>The members of the <rs>Inner Temple</rs> would have deserved ill of the public had they permitted any consideration for the feelings of individuals to stand between them and strict justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>They are the guardians of the honor and character of the bar. The bar forms an important portion of the social fabric, its honor and character is in some respects an indication of the national honor and character, and the public as well as the profession are in every way interested in anything ending to make the gown of a barrister what it is in the main &mdash; an emblem of honor and respect. </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
