<head>Yankee rejoicing</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> It is a well known fact in the history of the human race, that those who are most subject to the extremity of terror in the presence of actual danger are precisely those who are most noisy most boastful, and most extravagant, when it has disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>We might give many illustrations of the fact from the pages of history as well as romance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>But we conceive it unnecessary to look farther for an example than to the exhibition which the <rs>Yankees</rs> are now making of themselves, to the scandal of all men who hold the human species in any sort of regard, and the contempt of the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But <num value="1">one</num> fort night ago all Yankeedom was trembling in the very agony of mortal terror, because their territory was invaded and they could not pluck up the spirit to meet the invader and try conclusions with him in the field of deadly strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A spectacle so despicable as that presented by Yankeedom, we will venture to say, never yet presented itself to a contemptuous world.--Yet no sooner do they obtain a short respite from the fear of imminent danger than they give in to all the wild extravagance with which semi-barbarous nations are wont to express their gratitude for deliverance from what they perceive to be a peril of the most portentous magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Had the last spark of life been crushed out of the prostrate Confederacy &mdash; had <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> presented the heads of <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and his Cabinet to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in a basket as the head of <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> the <rs>Baptist</rs> was presented of old to a tyrant not much more cruel, and far more respectable from his abilities, the rejoicing could hardly have been greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Like the <name>Chinese</name>, to whom they have been more than once compared, the <rs>Yankees</rs> are but little more than full grown children in every thing but avarice and ferocity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> We are confident that more extravagant demonstrations were made on the late occasion of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s retreat, in the smallest town in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> or New York, than have been made throughout the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> in honor of all the victories we have ever gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>And yet no nation, of which there is any account in history, ever ran such a career of glory, all the difficulties under which it has been run being taken into consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The cause of the difference is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Success to the <rs>Yankees</rs> is a thing so unusual that they hail it as they hail the arrival of a Prince or a Japanese embassy &mdash; as an event wholly unexpected &mdash; as a fortunate occurrence which might never happen again, and of which it is therefore proper to make the most while it is still fresh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The Confederates, on the other hand, look for victory as a thing to be expected from every encounter with the enemy, and they are neither surprised nor startled out of their propriety when it occurs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A reverse is to them the exception to a general rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It makes far more impression on them than a victory, because it is not what they expect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Prone as the <rs>Yankee</rs> mind is to fly off at a tangent, the propensity is stimulated to the utmost by the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>All the lies that have been told about <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> are merely designed to keep up the war fever among a people who know not how to bear either success or defeat with even tolerable equanimity. </p> </div3>

<head>Seward on the <name>Tripod</name> once more.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> <persName n="Seward,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, not content with the unenviable reputation which his ratiocinations have already procured him, both at home and abroad, is prophesying once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We are glad to see it. There can be no surer sign that our cause will prosper than to hear him fore telling its early destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He is a great prophet in his way, but his way is a very peculiar <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>His predictions must always be taken in a reverse direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>If he foretells a thing, we may be sure it will never happen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> He is chagrined, it appears, at the frequent protests of his <num value="90">ninety</num>-day notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The war, he told us often, was to be ended in <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>. It has not been ended in <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> and <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>, because everybody has not done his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>This looks to us very much like saying that it is not ended because it still keeps on.--The beginning of the end, however, he assures us, is at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If he had not told us <sic>so so</sic> often before, we should be more disposed to believe him. As it is at present, we must wait until we see the result, before we can make up our minds to believe him a true prophet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He believes in <persName n="Johnson,,Andy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Johnson,Andy,,,"><foreName>Andy</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, and it is not wonderful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>A fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind, and <persName><foreName>Andy</foreName></persName> is a thorough paced traitor, as <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> is himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The <num value="1">one</num> has betrayed the liberties of his native State, the other has betrayed the liberties of all Yankeedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>How could they avoid loving each other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> tells the world, and he wishes the world to believe it, that <placeName reg="Louisiana, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7007523" n="1.000 4898" reg="missouri">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, &amp;c, have petitioned to be restored to his Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He knows this to he false and he ought to know that he will not be believed in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, for which market his wares are designed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He told the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> the same story <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago, and it was received with a hiss of derision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>A State-means the majority of the people of a State fairly ascertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The persons of the <name>States</name> named who desire to return, so far from constituting a majority are indecorously few, and the very refuse of the population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>No man knows this better than <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>As for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, she has <num value="50000">50,000</num> troops in the held at this moment &mdash; probably a great many more.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> The sanctimonious style in which this oration winds up, as well as the professions of patriotism with which it abounds, are worthy of notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He wants nothing for himself, the disinterested <rs>Spartan</rs> that he is. He has reduced his country to slavery, and destroyed its constitution, all for the public good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He wants nothing better than to die in the streets of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> A gentleman who has recently arrived from the <rs>North</rs> brings us, among other things, a number of a new monthly journal entitled "The <orgName n="Old Guard" type="newspaper">Old Guard</orgName>, a monthly journal, devoted to the principles of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>," It contains several able papers; among them, "How to Treat Unconstitutional Acts of Congress," "The Administration as a Gold Cambler;" "<persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> on Federal Usurpations and Despotism;" "Strength of Armies," &amp;c. In the article on How to Treat Unconstitutional Acts of Congress, it counsels Resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It declares that "when a free people submit to oppressive acts, passed in violation of their Constitution, for a single day, they have thrown down the palladium of their liberty; submit to despotism for an hour, and you concede the principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The history of the downfall of Republics is the same in all ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inch that is yielded to despotism &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blow dealt at the <rs>Constitution</rs>, that is not resisted &mdash; is the beginning of the end of the nation's ruin."

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> Nominally, the point left for the decision of the jury was whether the <name>Crown</name> or a firm of <placeName reg="Liverpool, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2463110">Liverpool</placeName> merchants were the rightful owners of an unfinished ship; but, practically, the matter for adjudication was whether the ship-builders of this country are precluded from constructing ships which <unclear/> eventually be devoted to warlike purposes against a State with which we are at present at peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>On the <num value="1">one</num> side exists the obligations to preserve intact our commercial rights, and on the other those which make it incumbent upon us to prevent our ports and dock-yards being made available for the equipping and fitting out of ships or armaments for the purposes of aggression against a friendly Power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Passing from the purely legal consideration of the case, it is manifest that, on grounds of expediency, a maritime nation like <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, possessing commercial relations with every quarter of the globe, is bound faithfully and strictly to fulfill the duties appertaining to strict neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>We are neutrals to-day; we may be belligerents to-morrow; <hi rend="italics">and as we do to others so we must expect to be done by.</hi> The issue raised in the case of the <rs>Alexandra</rs> was <num value="1">one</num> consequently not less important in its consequences to ourselves than to those more immediately interested in the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> America has for up wards of had a century had a Foreign Enlistment act similar to our own, and the decisions of American Judges afford a key to its interpretations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>In a case brought on appeal before the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, that great jurist, <persName n="Story,Mister-Justice,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00166" reg="mostcommon:Story,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister-Justice">Mr. Justice</roleName> <surname>Story</surname></persName>, laid it down that although by the terms of the <rs>Foreign Enlistment</rs> act the subjects of a neutral State were precluded from equipping or arming vessels for the purpose of aggression against a friendly Power, they were not precluded from equipping and arming them for the purpose of sale to any <num value="1">one</num>, belligerent or other wise, who chose to purchase them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/><hi rend="italics">In other words, a neutral may equip a ship of war just as he stay construct a <unclear/> if he intends and to use or have of used against a <unclear/> Power, but merely to sell it. Adopting this routing,</hi> the <rs>Chief Baren</rs> laid it down that a British subject might equip a ship of war with a view to selling it to either <unclear/> without infringing the provisions of the <rs>Foreign Enlistment</rs> act. Indeed, in the course of the trial the learned <rs>Judge</rs> asked the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney General</rs> whether such a course would not be legal, and as the latter declined to reply in may be taken that it is no. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> The <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</rs> went so far as to say that the object of the <rs>Foreign Enlistment</rs> act could not have been the protection of belligerents, for otherwise the exportation of contraband of war would equally have been prohibited, and that consequently <name>English</name> ship-builders had as much right to sell armed ships to either belligerent as they had to sell gunpowder of cannon, or other munitions of war. In the case, however, before the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, it did not become necessary to apply these principles in their fullest signification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</rs> left it to the jury whether the <rs>Alexandra</rs> was "equipped, armed, furnished or lifted out," or whether it was the intention of the defendants to "equipped, armed, furnish or fit her out" within <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> dominion for purposes of aggression against the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The act does not prohibit the "building" of ships of any description, and as it was shown that she was not, at the time of seizure, "equipped or armed," and there was nothing to show that it was intended that she should be so equipped within <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> dominions, the defendants were entitled to a verdict. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> The <rs>Alabama</rs> was frequently referred to in the course of the trial, and it may possibly illustrate the interpretation which must be put on the <rs>Foreign Enlistment</rs> act when we say that the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</rs>, in summing up, pointed out that in her case the act was not infringed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>She was built in an English port, but she was equipped and armed in Portuguese waters, where of course the <rs>English Crown</rs> possessed no jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>It may be said that, according to this interpretation, the <rs>Foreign Enlistment</rs> act will prove a dead letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>If the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</rs>'s views of the object of which that act was framed &mdash; namely, not to protect belligerents, but to prevent vessels equipped for the rival Powers in neighboring docks fighting whilst still in our harbors or in our waters &mdash; is correct, it will not. If, on the other hand, its object was the protection of the commerce of a friendly Power, it certainly seems (to say the least of it) that its provisions can be very easily evaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>However, with consequences neither judges nor juries have anything to do. It is at all events, a satisfaction to feel that the <rs>Lord</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</rs> has acted in accordance with a high American authority in his interpretation of the law, and it will be impossible for the <rs>American Government</rs> to question the soundness of his opinion without also impugning that of the greatest of their lawyers, <persName n="Story,Mister-Justice,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="mostcommon:Story,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister-Justice">Mr. Justice</roleName> <surname>Story</surname></persName>. </p> </q><!--<bibl n="The Post"></bibl>--></cit>
